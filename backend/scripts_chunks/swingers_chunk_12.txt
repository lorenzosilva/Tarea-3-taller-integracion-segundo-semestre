CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT 10 Mike is sleeping in the passenger seat. TRENT Wake up, baby. MIKE (stirring) Whu? TRENT Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby! Trent points out a mountain range. It is now the only thing separating them from their destination. The surreal glow of the desert sky is accentuated by the loud slashing of the cobalt and ruby lasers emanating from a source masked by the craggy peaks. Mike slowly stirs from his slumber. He is transfixed by this affrontation of nature. It is his first glimpse of the city without God. MIKE (in reverie) Vegas. CUT TO: 11 EXT. VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT 11 The shrill cry of Basie's fat brass section heralds the arrival of the young swingers. Their eyes drink every watt of golden light as Sinatra's crooning urges them on. Mike has either had enough sleep or so little that it no longer matters. Either way, there's no turning back. They roll up to a casino valet. TILT UP to a skull and crossbones which looms overhead. CUT TO: 12 INT. TREASURE ISLAND

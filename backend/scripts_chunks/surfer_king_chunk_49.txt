containing their laughter. But EDDIE notices them leaving. All of this has happened under the watchful though distant eye of ALEX. EDDIE goes into the restroom. EDDIE exits the restroom and goes to his cart. At this point ALEX and ROBBIE walk up to him. ALEX Hey Eddie. What have you got? EDDIE Water balloon. EDDIE reached onto his cart and pulls out a pair of scissors, eyeing them. ALEX You got this? EDDIE Yeah. Rookies! ALEX and ROBBIE walk away as EDDIE places a "RESTROOM CLOSED" sandwich board in front of the door. Just then BIG MIKE rushes up. BIG MIKE (big hurry-potty emergency) Oh Eddie. Listen, I know you're working but you hold on for just a minute. I've been so busy, and I really gotta go. EDDIE motions and tries to find the words.... EDDIE But....no.... But BIG MIKE is already in. Eddies waits for it, wincing, and there is a loud splash... BIG MIKE (O.S.) (echoing through the door) Yeahhhah that's cold! EDDIE just shrugs and puts away his scissors. 24 EXT -MOMENTS LATER -

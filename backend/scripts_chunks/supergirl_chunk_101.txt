It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space. ETHAN I'm sorry, I don't understand. SUPERGIRL It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me. ETHAN Come on, let's ride. They walk to the slowly revolving Ferris wheel and hop aboard one of the gondola cars. ETHAN I used to work here summers when I was a kid. SUPERGIRL Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you. ETHAN Let's talk about us, not her. SUPERGIRL Tell me where I can find her. ETHAN I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news. Ethan puts his arm around her shoulders, casually, no big deal. SUPERGIRL But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you. ETHAN I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives. SUPERGIRL We can't do that. ETHAN Why not ? SUPERGIRL We're from different worlds. ETHAN Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes

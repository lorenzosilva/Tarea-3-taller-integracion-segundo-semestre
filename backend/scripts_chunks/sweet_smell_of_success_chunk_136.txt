where you don't know what's involved... Sally is putting paper in the typewriter, trying to hold her head up. SALLY I'm not judging... Sidney comes closer to her. He puts his hand on the nape of her neck, carrassing her. Under his touch, the girl is unhappy, and yet at the same time, responsive. Sidney still has power over her but she is disturbed by feelings of shame. Feeling her relaxed, Sidney bends and kisses her on the side of the throat with more than negligence, for something about her always excites him; his aggression tune in with her submissiveness. SALLY (pathetically) I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you... SIDNEY (murmuring) That's no way to talk... SALLY Or what you see in me, for that matter... SIDNEY Stay down town tonight. Maybe we'll take in a show, etc. SALLY If you want me to - The phone in the bedroom rings. Sidney, reacting sharply, forgets his advances to Sally as he turns towards the bedroom. SIDNEY (exhilarated) You see?

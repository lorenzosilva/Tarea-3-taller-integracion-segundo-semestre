MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK 9 Aokee's is a restaurant near Thunder Bay. It seats about 50 and is lavishly decorated in a Hawaiian Surf and Ocean motif, with surf memorabilia, fish nets, surfboards, and the like. AOKEE is a large 375 pound plus apparently Hawaiian man, late twenties, early thirties, wearing a purple Hawaiian shirt, blue shorts and a white chef's apron that says KISS THE COOK. WE SEE him on a pay phone behind the counter.

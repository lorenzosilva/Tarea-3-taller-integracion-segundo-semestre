Picks up a box of YELLOW STICK-PINS, affixing them to the map - one for every faxed face. Here's "Jason Corey, Age 14." Last seen in "Riverside, Ca." on "10-16-99." Sure enough, O'Ryan had circled "Riverside, Ca." on this map. Next to it he'd written "10-16." Mackelway sticks a yellow pin in Riverside. Next, the fax concerning "Anna Casitas, Age 22." Last Seen? "Macon, Ga." on "5-6-00." Of course, O'Ryan had circled "Macon" too. Beside it he'd written "5-6." So Macon gets a yellow pin. 38. Mackelway continues, as: FRAN (O.S.) Got nothing on the last fax. Mackelway turns. In comes Fran. FRAN (CONT'D) Came from a business center at a Mariott in Dallas. Nobody saw who sent it. Mackelway nods. Then they both turn... Charlton enters the room. CHARLTON Whadda we know about the map? MACKELWAY It matches the faxes, Sir. Almost perfectly. Charlton approaches the map: 1,242 cities, circled in red. Mackelway continues with the yellow pins: one for every HAVE YOU SEEN ME? (45 of them so far.)

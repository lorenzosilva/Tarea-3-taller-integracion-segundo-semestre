over the fallen ones, and look to COWBOY for a yea or nay. COWBOY generously waves and makes a thumbs up signal, and the swords are put away. The seated lifeguards all raise their fists and shout. LIFEGUARDS (together) Lifeguards! Lifeguards! Lifeguards! The guards holding COWBOY set him down in front of an elevated platform that has a microphone.. COWBOY picks up the surfer king trophy and walks to the platform. He sets the trophy on a table next to the microphone, arranging it carefully. We see now there is a large banner hanging at the back of the wave pool that says "WATER WORLD WELCOMES EMPLOYEE OLYMPIANS". COWBOY moves to the microphone and raises his arm in a regal manner and speaks. COWBOY (to all) Let the games...begin! The seated crowd now stands and cheers loudly. We see a group of three people, two male and one female, adults we will later identify as JUDGES. They nod approvingly and write something down on their clipboards. We see BIG MIKE near them, smiling broadly. 59

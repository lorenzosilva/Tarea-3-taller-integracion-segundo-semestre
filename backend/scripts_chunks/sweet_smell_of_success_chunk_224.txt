AND SIDNEY Susan interrupts, with a simplicity which is damaging. SUSAN Don't bother to lie, Sidney. (moving away) I don't care anymore. LONGER ANGLE Sidney decides that it is wiser not to argue. He assumes a tolerant sympathy. He moves towards her. SIDNEY Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day. Feeling sorry for yourself won't help. SUSAN (shaking her head) I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother. To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family - SIDNEY (moving towards her again) Come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...? Now she turns to him. SUSAN And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship. SIDNEY What ship? She walks past him, still aimlessly wandering about the room; then she turns back, indicates herself. SUSAN THIS ship. She studies Sidney. SUSAN Don't you know how my brother will see you after tonight?

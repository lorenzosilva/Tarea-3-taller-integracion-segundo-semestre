TIFFANY drive off. ALEX (collecting himself) Well. Just another summer at Water World. The group begins walking toward the exit gate, as we go wide and helicopter upward. They get smaller and smaller in the shot as we hear the conversation continue. ROBBIE You know Katie, I really am sorry I was such a jerk this summer. KATIE We'll be going to the same high school. You'll have plenty of chances to make it up to me. Let's see, there's Homecoming, the Christmas Dance, Valentines Day...and of course, the prom... ROBBIE Alex? ALEX Yeah? ROBBIE I'm gonna need to borrow twenty bucks. Page 81 of 81 ALEX Yep. We helicopter up for a final shot over the whole park. THE END

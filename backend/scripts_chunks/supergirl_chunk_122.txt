Don't leave me. SUPERGIRL You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source. He stands up and takes her hand. ETHAN Before you go... SUPERGIRL What? ETHAN Just one kiss. For old times' sake. SUPERGIRL And you can see how you feel about me, right? ETHAN Yes. She closes her eyes and

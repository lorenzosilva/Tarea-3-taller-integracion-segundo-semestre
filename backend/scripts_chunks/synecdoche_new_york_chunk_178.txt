... touched by the sadness of Adele's neighbor. So close to death. Reminds me of granny. I should really call her. Remember how Granny Bascomb bounced me on her knee pretending to be a horsie. I loved that so much. Say thank you to Adele's neighbor. CADEN Thank you. OLD PERSON #2 (ACTOR) (pause, listens, then:) You're very welcome, young lady. MILLICENT'S VOICE Now say, have a very good day. CADEN Have a very good day. OLD PERSON #2 (ACTOR) (pause, listens, then:) I will indeed. 183INT. 31Y WALK-IN CLOSET (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2050 - NIGHT 183 It's dark. Caden lies in bed, attached to his pumps. MILLICENT'S VOICE ... miss him. Why did he have to get bored with me? Everyone gets bored with me. I'm not very bright. And since I put on that weight, I don't get the looks I used to. It's not that bad. Lots of people have it worse. I've got a job and place to stay. Adele is nice to me. And so smart and talented. I don't understand her artwork, but that's just me. I wish I'd gone to college.

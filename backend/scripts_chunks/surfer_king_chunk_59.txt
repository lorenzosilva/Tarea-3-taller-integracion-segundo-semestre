KATIE No. (pause) I'm surprised you're not a guard, coming from the ocean and all. ROBBIE Let's just say I missed my chance, and Alex saved me from a death worse than fate. I was very nearly a trash rat. KATIE (frowns) Oh. Good save. ALEX has distracted AMY all he could and they return from the kitchen. AMY Well. That was exciting. Maybe next time you can show me how to scrub the grill. Come on, Katie. They leave. ALEX (to ROBBIE, interested) Well...how'd you do? ROBBIE (thinking) Mmmm. I told her how beautiful the California sunsets are. ALEX Good job. You work fast. Hey it's time for our break. Bring your swimsuit? ROBBIE Yeah. The Wave? ALEX The Wave. I love that water.

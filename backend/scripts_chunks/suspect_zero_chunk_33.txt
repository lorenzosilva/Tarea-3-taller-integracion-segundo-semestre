First thing he sees is that SYMBOL again: a circle-with-a- slash-through-it... staring right at him. 21. But this time, it's been carved into somebody's back. Mackelway stares. So does Fran.

A BESPECTACLED CORONER examines him. Victim #2, BARNEY FULCHER, lies on another, his ample frame yet to be examined.

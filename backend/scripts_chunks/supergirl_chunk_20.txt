MAN in a three-piece pin-stripe suit grabs her elbow. ELDERLY MAN I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes. SELENA What do you want? ELDERLY MAN Western Europe. SELENA I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski. ELDERLY MAN No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains. Selena leaves him negotiating boundary lines with Bianca and strolls over to a sour-faced man in suede who has been scowling at her over his cigarette. SELENA Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world. NIGEL It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me. SELENA I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places. NIGEL You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.

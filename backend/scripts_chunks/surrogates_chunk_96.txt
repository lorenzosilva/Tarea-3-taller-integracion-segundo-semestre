The clothing is shredded, the remains spray-painted. GREER, wary of being recognized, continues on. EXT. RESERVATION STREET - DAY GREER walks through a poor but surprisingly pleasant neighborhood-- rowhouses, gardens. Very few cars. DREADS look like ordinary working-class folks. A BARBECUE, a group of RESIDENTS laughing and drinking. Greer inhales the SMOKE as he passes, smiles to himself. A couple of FRIENDLY DOGS trot curiously after him for a moment, then return to the barbecue. GREER, not paying attention, brushes past an ELDERLY MALE PEDESTRIAN. GREER Excuse me. PEDESTRIAN (smiles and nods) No problem. A PLAYGROUND a short distance on,.LOTS OF KIDS shrieking and running. Greer pauses here, taking this in. These are the first children we've seen, outside of a TV ad. A CLOUD OF DIESEL SMOKE from a decrepit BUS. Greer CHOKES on this, but doesn't seem displeased. His body language has become more relaxed as he gets further into the rez, getting his land legs back. INT. RESERVATION

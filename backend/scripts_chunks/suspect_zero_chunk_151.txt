but Vic's already past us. Something about him attracts Mackelway's attention. The walk, the attitude. Something. So Mackelway is watching - without really knowing why - as Vic crosses the parking lot, heading for his rig. It's a beast. Vic climbs in, unaware that he's being watched. Mackelway looks away, chiding himself for allowing the guy to distract him. That WAITRESS comes by with more coffee. Mackelway smiles, looking absently out the window again. And sees a LITTLE BOY of 5, in the cab of Vic's rig... But this little boy is SCREAMING, struggling to get out of his car-seat, until Vic grabs the kid by the shoulders, roughly... all of this visible through the windshield. Mackelway locks in on the kid. Holy shit... Vic's rig pulls out. The kid pounds on his window. Looks like he's saying "Lemme out of here! I want my Mommy!" He might be little Charlie - we can't tell from here. But we can see that Vic is yelling at him: "Shut up!" And we can see that Vic's truck is refrigerated.

scene takes place two years after the accident. MITCHELL STEPHENS is playing with his headset, which doesn't seem to be working. He summons a STEWARDESS over. MITCHELL I'm not getting any sound. The STEWARDESS checks the headset and confirms the problem. STEWARDESS I'll find you another pair. The STEWARDESS leaves. A young woman seated beside MITCHELL hands him her headset. ALISON You can have mine. MITCHELL takes ALISON'S headset. Their eyes lock for a moment. ALISON (CONT'D) Yes, we do know each other. I'm Alison Jones. MITCHELL Alison Jones. ALISON I was a friend of Zoe's. We went to school together. I used to come to your house. MITCHELL (pretending to remember) Yes. ALISON Ally. That was my nickname. MITCHELL Ally. That's right. ALISON How are you? MITCHELL I'm just fine, Ally. What about you? ALISON I'm fine. Still working with my father. MITCHELL And what does he do again? ALISON He used to work with you. Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife. Pause.

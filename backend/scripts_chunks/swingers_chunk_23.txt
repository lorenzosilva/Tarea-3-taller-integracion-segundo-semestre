TRENT Hey, man, I'm down too, you know. MIKE Yea, how much? TRENT I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe. MIKE Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop? TRENT Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table. MIKE You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry. TRENT Baby, don't talk like that, baby. MIKE Let's just leave. TRENT Baby, you're money. You're the big winner. MIKE Let's go. TRENT (condescending) Who's the big winner? Mike looks away, shaking his head in disgust. TRENT (lifting Mike's reluctant hand from the wrist like a boxing champ) Mikey's the big winner. MIKE (shaking his head to hide a smirk) What an asshole. TRENT Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner. The same WAITRESS

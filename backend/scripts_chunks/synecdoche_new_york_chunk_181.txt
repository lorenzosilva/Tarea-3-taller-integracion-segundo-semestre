SYN, NY - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - JULY 30, 2007 122. 187INT. ELLEN'S BEDROOM - (2050) - NIGHT 187 Ellen lies in bed watching Eric sleep next to her. ELLEN There was supposed to be something else. I was to have something. A calm. A love. Children. A child, at least. Children. Meaning. I am always on the verge, never more than a tiny shove from tears. I can feel them in my chest now. That squeezing pressure. And it is so tempting to let go, but I am afraid, the next time maybe, I will never stop crying. I miss my husband even though he is lying here. He hates me. Oh God. I have disappointed him and he hates me. The one person who should be able to see me and he won't look. He will never look again. 188INT. 31Y WALK-IN CLOSET (INT.

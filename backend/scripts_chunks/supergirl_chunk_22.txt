to ordinary eyes...is a DARK EERIE SHAPE OF SOMETHING HIDEOUS. BACK TO SCENE. Quick as a cat, Selena bats the cigarette case out of his hand and sends it spinning into the shrubbery. All traces of the Shadow behind her have disappeared. NIGEL Sorry. Forgot you were trying to quit. Nigel snags a glass of champagne off the tray of a nearby waiter and sips it insolently. SELENA Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head. NIGEL You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate. SELENA I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber. Nigel locks eyes with her. NIGEL Make me. He takes another insolent sip of champagne...arid discovers a scorpion perched on the rim of his glass. Nigel spits out the champagne and, drops the glass. Everyone laughs at him. NIGEL Balefire on you, Selena! SELENA (grinning) You Scorpios can never take a joke. All quests have fallen silent, staring at the altercation between the two of them.

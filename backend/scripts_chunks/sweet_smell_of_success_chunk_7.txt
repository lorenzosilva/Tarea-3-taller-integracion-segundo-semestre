Sidney, Joe. How do you like it? I'm running out of alibis! No, I asked Hunsecker to withhold the item, until he could give it a fine, fat paragraph. The column was running over and I didn't want you kissed off with just a line... INT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT Robard is a stolid, secure man, balding and with a moustache. He has a morose sense of humor. He is speaking from a telephone on a little desk at the end of the bar. In background, the Club is open, but there are few customers as yet. Some recorded jazz is being played while the musicians are still arriving, strolling past in background, depositing their overcoats and music cases in the little closet assigned to them. ROBARD (in answer to Sidney) Of course. (he listens to protest from Sidney) What is this, Sidney, a kissing game? You're a liar - that's a publicity man's nature. I wouldn't hire you if you wasn't a liar. I pay you a C-and-a-half a week wherein you plant big lies about me and the Club all over the map. (a pause) Yeah,

EVERYONE TOGETHER (CONT'D) (on the chorus) Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho. Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho. As the song ends (abruptly), AOKEE bumps a surfboard (part of the restaurant's decoration) with his hip, knocking it and another one to the ground. Page 21 of 81 There is a loud crash and everyone pauses and looks at AOKEE, waiting to see if he gets mad. AOKEE looks down at his hip, and makes a puppy-dog face like "I didn't know my hips were that big...." Everyone claps, laughing. AOKEE takes a bow. 14 INT -LATER THAT DAY - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK 14 ROBBIE and ALEX are carrying bus tubs loaded with dirty dishes back toward the kitchen from the dining area. AOKEE is sipping on a smoothie and leaning back on a counter. There are only a few customers in the eating area. They set the tubs down on a counter that passes to the back area. An unseen person takes them into the dishwashing area. AOKEE (to ALEX and ROBBIE) You did good work today. Here. I made you some of my special Power Smoothies.

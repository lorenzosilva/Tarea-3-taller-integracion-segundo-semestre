in line for the concessions pot. 65 EXT LATER THAT DAY - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL EAST SIDE 65 An obstacle course has been set up, and the event provides a background to the dialogue that follows. AOKEE has some papers, and is talking to ALEX and ROBBIE. AOKEE (looking through the papers) This isn't good. (looking at ALEX and ROBBIE) It's the same as every year. Pretty much a dead heat going into the surf championship tomorrow morning. ALEX I can't believe those guys screwed up the CPR. ROBBIE Hard to blame them. No one told them they had to put their mouth on yours until the last minute. Yuck. ALEX Bunch of babies. AOKEE (to ROBBIE) It's going to be up to you. We slip a little. You have to make up. That trophy need a new home. They look over at the obstacle course where a tiny grounds kid is jumping up and down and raising his arms ROCKY-style. AOKEE (CONT'D) You need to make up. You ready? Tomorrow morning last event. You our last hope. ROBBIE just looks at both of them nods and sighs

a suspect in the fucking hand. Accident. Do you know how hard it is to work a keyboard with one hand? TORVALDS Whatever you can do to me, he can do worse. I'm already dead. The only place I stand a chance is back in my country. I have friends there. ROBERTS I tell you what, you tell me what I want to know and I guarantee you'll be on the next flight to Finland.

One of the agents looks surprisingly like Gabriel's merc that carried the young blonde girl killed outside the bank earlier. TORVALDS (V.O.) (over speaker) I'll tell you what I know.

It's important that I speak with him as soon as possible. Thank you. INT. FBI INTERROGATION ROOM -

- JULY 30, 2007 84. 131INT. WAREHOUSE - CITY SET - 2026 - DAY131 The actors are in their "apartments" and rehearsal is in progress. Caden walks along the scaffolding followed by Hazel. He hands scraps of paper to each actor he passes, then turns his attention to Sammy and Claire. She's in her underwear and getting dressed. Sammy comes up behind her and rubs her ass. CLAIRE I don't like that guy you got to play you. SAMMY You don't like Sammy? Why? I think he's good. CLAIRE I think you need to fire him. Caden hands her a scrap of paper. CLAIRE (CONT'D) (reading, then to Caden) Oh, fuck you. I'm forty-five years old. I don't want to do this shit anymore. SAMMY I'm not firing him, Claire. He's the best thing in the show. Next to you. CLAIRE He's coming on to me. He's feeling my ass during rehearsal. SAMMY He's your husband. Claire turns to the real Caden and screams. CLAIRE He's not my Godamn husband! You are! What is wrong with you? The actor underneath them pounds on his ceiling.

a road approaching I-30. But there are three cars between them - Mackelway can't get a clean look at Vic's license plate. Vic approaches the Interstate. So do the three cars between them. Vic passes the Interstate on-ramp. The three cars turn on to it... putting Mackelway right on Vic's tail. He grabs his cel, dials. This truck has license plates from ten states. MACKELWAY (INTO CEL) This is Mackelway. I need a run down on a plate. Texas: Delta-142-Romeo-Victor- Alpha. Got that? He puts the cel down, but doesn't hang up. Vic just made a turn onto a VAST DIRT LOT. A huge BANNER overhead reads, "FOUNDERS DAY CARNIVAL!!!" 171 EXT. CARNIVAL - PARKING LOT - CONTINUING 171 There are several BIG-RIGS parked here, but the vast majority of the vehicles we see are garden-variety cars and SUV's. A few pick-ups. There are RIDES at this carnival: Pony rides, a ferris wheel, and a huge ring of Barbeques, each fired up and cooking. Must be a thousand people in attendance today. Vic parks his rig.

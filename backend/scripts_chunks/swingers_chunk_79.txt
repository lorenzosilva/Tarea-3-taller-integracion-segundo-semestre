think? SUE ... Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious... TRENT Yeah, but three days is kinda the money... MIKE (interrupting sarcastically) Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number... CHARLES ... then ask where you met her... MIKE Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and then I'll ask what she looks like. (pause) Then I'll ask if we fucked. How's that, Tee? Is that "the money"? The guys laugh. TRENT Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party. SUE Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you. MIKE How long are you guys gonna wait to call your honeys? TRENT & SUE Six days. CUT TO: 51 EXT. THE DRESDEN - PARKING LOT - OUT BACK - NIGHT 51 The swingers are leaving through the back door. The doorway is congested with another group of guys who are entering. A BALD GUY with a goatee brushes by Sue. SUE Watch where you're going, asshole. BALD GUY What'd you say, bitch?

is passed out in a pool of her own drool. The PHONE continues to RING. 47. 64 EXT. NEWTON MONTESSORI SCHOOL - DAY 64 Holly hits the phone and then presses speed dial. We see "Yellow Cab" scroll across the phone. She hits "SEND." MAN (O.S.) Can I give you a lift? HOLLY Look, creep, I don't think so -- She stands up, ready for a fight. And there, next to her is her father; transformed. Under his arm is a three- foot-tall stuffed giraffe wrapped with a big red bow. HOLLY Daddy? (recognition) Daddy! She runs to him and wraps her arms around him. STANLEY Hey, sweetheart. HOLLY Daddy... What are you doing here? I missed you so much. STANLEY Me too, baby. I brought you something. He holds the stuffed giraffe to her. HOLLY Oh, Daddy. If Mom finds out you're here she's gonna have you thrown back in jail. STANLEY It's okay, baby. Let me give you a ride home. He grabs her stuff. STANLEY C'mon. He walks toward Ginger's silver Mercedes CLK which he's borrowing. Holly runs and jumps on his back.

centers, detox units... ALISON Then...when did she get better? MITCHELL She didn't. ALISON But you said... MITCHELL That's where I'm going. To see her. ALISON She's in trouble? MITCHELL Yes. (beat) Do you find there's something strange about this meat? ALISON stares at her plate. MITCHELL summons the STEWARDESS. STEWARDESS Some more wine? MITCHELL I'm afraid this meat is overdone. STEWARDESS I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish? MITCHELL What is it? STEWARDESS Poached salmon. MITCHELL considers this. He is polite, but slightly edgy. MITCHELL Do you have a cold plate? STEWARDESS We do. MITCHELL Is there shrimp on it? STEWARDESS Yes. MITCHELL If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp... STEWARDESS (smiling) I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate. MITCHELL Well, let's see what we get. The STEWARDESS leaves with MITCHELL'S food. MITCHELL gets up. MITCHELL (CONT'D) (to ALISON) If you could excuse me for a moment.

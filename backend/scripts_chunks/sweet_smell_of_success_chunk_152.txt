J.J. walks away across the stage. Sidney strolls after him. ANOTHER ANGLE A TRACKING SHOT. Sidney comes up beside Hunsecker, falls into step beside him. As they cross towards a water cooler at the back of the stage, they talk in rapid undertone. HUNSECKER I got that boy coming over here. (a glance at Sidney) What's so funny? SIDNEY (who is smiling faintly) With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good. HUNSECKER (narrowly) I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work. SIDNEY (shrugging) Can't hurt... HUNSECKER (incredulously) Can't hurt? I had to get him back his job. SIDNEY (smugly) I like that, too. (closer, faster) Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion. We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze. Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze!

with her. JIMMY Can I give you a lift? LINDA Oh, no thanks. JIMMY It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions. Linda's heart sinks as she realises she doesn't know how to get rid of him politely. CUT TO: EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL SUNSET Ethan batters the top off a ventilator and crawls out onto the roof. He turns and quickly replaces the aluminum top, bashing it firmly closed with his fist. He straightens up, sweat-soaked, bedraggled, haggard and exhausted, looking like an escaped lunatic with his disheveled hair and his torn hospital robe. He heaves a sigh of relief, and turns to see Selena standing behind him, her silk cape billowing in the breeze. SELENA Give up? Ethan takes a beat to make sure he's not hallucinating, then he summons new reserves of strength and runs over to the TALL BRICK SMOKESTACK from the hospital's incinerator. ETHAN Never! He starts to climb up the steel ladder on the side of the chimney. SELENA What goes up must come down. EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE.

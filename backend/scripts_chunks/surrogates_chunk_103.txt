He looks a mess-- torn clothing, bloodstains, bruises. Suddenly he's SHOVED from behind, falls to the pavement. WHEELS Oops. The assailant is a FREAK SURRIE-- extra ARMS, WHEELS where his feet should be. A moment later, Greer is surrounded by three rich, FREAKY TEENS. (CONTINUED) 68. CONTINUED: They've customized their surries in completely bizarre ways, in addition to the usual tattoos and piercings. Besides WHEELS, there's a hairless teen with six EYES scattered around his head. A GIRL has SPIKES sticking out of her skull and flesh and REPTILE SKIN. EYES Watch where you're going, meat. SPIKES What are you doin' off the rez? She bumps against GREER as he picks himself up, he shrinks from the spikes. She shoots a small blast of FLAME from her nostrils, then GIGGLES. GREER I'm not a Dread. WHEELS Then you oughta return that surrie, looks like shit. WHEELS comes at Greer again, Greer moves and TRIPS him-- but he just lands on an extra arm and rights himself. EYES Hey, it wants to play.

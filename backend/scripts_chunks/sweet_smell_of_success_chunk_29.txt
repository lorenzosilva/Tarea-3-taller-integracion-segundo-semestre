me! Find me a door somewhere - I walked in without knocking! Sidney is trying to needle Steve; Steve's temper would normally have exploded; but now he controls it. STEVE I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop. For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night? SIDNEY (needling) Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years! D'ANGELO (soothingly) Come on boys, break it up... STEVE (overriding D'Angelo) The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man! SIDNEY His face tightens; he appears to be mortally insulted and controlling himself with difficulty. He turns his back swiftly on Steve, addressing Susan in a voice that has a sharp edge. SIDNEY If you're going home, Susie, I'll drop you off... Sidney starts quickly up the fire escape. This makes Steve angry and he steps forward to follow him. But Chico contrives, without seeming to interfere to obstruct Steve.

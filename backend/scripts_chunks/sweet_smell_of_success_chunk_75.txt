walks past Sidney, who continues rapidly: SIDNEY Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE! WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column... HUNSECKER (scornfully) Are you finished? SIDNEY (quickly) No, lemme finish. I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB! That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head. And Susan, like you said, she's growing up. Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here! HUNSECKER (incisively) Not "we", Sidney, you! SIDNEY (gamely) Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved. HUNSECKER (sardonically) Ha! My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years! Sidney quickly moves into J.J.'s path, desperate to hold his attention. SIDNEY I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong

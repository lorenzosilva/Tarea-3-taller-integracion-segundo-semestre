MARMONT - NIGHT 46 The swingers have left the party and are heading to their cars. They are all parked in a row, one behind the other. They each climb behind the wheel of their own car. They pull out in UNISON. They travel like a train with their bumpers ALMOST TOUCHING. CUT TO: 47 EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - NIGHT 47 SHOTS of the CAR-TRAIN driving and making turns. "O SOLE MIO" reprise. DISSOLVE TO: 48 EXT. THE DRESDEN - VERMONT AVE. - HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT 48 The car-train BREAKS UP to nose-in park behind the bar. They all "club" their steering wheels. CUT TO: 49 INT. "THE DRESDEN ROOM" - SAME 49 The SWINGERS lounge in a booth against the cork-paneled wall, sipping cocktails. They watch MARTY and ELAYNE, the resident lounge act, perform a jazz fusion cover of "Staying Alive" on synth and upright bass.

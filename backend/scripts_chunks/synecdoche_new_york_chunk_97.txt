94OMITTED94 A95 EXT. HOTEL TERRACE - 2017 - DAYA95 Caden watches Hazel and her family, laughing and enjoying each other on the terrace. The gaunt man sits with them. When they head to the pool, Caden just continues, without hesitation, to the edge of the roof, and begins to climb over. A passing lifeguard sees Caden, grabs him and wrestles him to the ground. 95INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S HOUSE - 2017 - NIGHT95 Caden pulls Olive's journal from under his pillow and reads from somewhere in the middle. OLIVE'S VOICE (with German accent) How I love Maria! She is so much more of a father than Caden ever was, with his drinking and unfortunate body odor and rotting teeth. I could only loathe him and perhaps pity him. But Maria! Caden blots his sopping brow and gums, sniffs under his arms. 96INT. HALLWAY (CLAIRE'S NYC APT.) - FALL 2018 - NIGHT 96 Caden, now walking with a cane, approaches an apartment door. There's a sad pilgrim cut-out taped to it. He knocks. CLAIRE (O.S.) Yes? CADEN It's me.

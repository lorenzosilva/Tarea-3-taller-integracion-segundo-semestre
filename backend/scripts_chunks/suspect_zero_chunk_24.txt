was a much more complex man than people realized. Jan is so raw that anything about Speck touches her now. 15. JAN (through tears) He was, wasn't he? O'RYAN I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am. She sniffs back a tear, thanks him with a smile. O'Ryan extends his hand to her. She takes it. He moves off. Beside her is a FRAMED PORTRAIT of Speck. We blow past it, and into the BLACK CREPE that is adorning the corner of the portrait's FRAME, and: BAM! We're rocketed back into a set of odd IMAGES again: 16 EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME 16 This time, everything before us is a blur of gray. We hear that wet wind. We hear our own heavy BREATHING, as if we were running somewhere... a VOICE, rising above the wind, seems to be saying: (O.S.) Please... The sound echoes oddly, as if bouncing off a satellite somewhere, or a distance of time and space. Then the sound and the soupy grayness VANISH. This vision just ended. When we pop back out of it, we're TIGHT on Mackelway... CUT TO: 17 INT.

makes you think so? MACKELWAY That's where Zero is. (Fran's a blank) Lloyd Simms - October 26, '99. Karen Sumpter - October 26, 2000. Both disappeared from Greenville. (still no reply) Zero comes back to the same spot, once a year. Today's the 25th. FRAN Wait. When did we establish that Zero was real? MACKELWAY O'Ryan thinks so. FRAN Do you? That's the million-dollar question, and it hangs there. Mackelway's about to answer... when he stops himself. Just noticing something. That MORGUE PHOTO from Logan, Utah: There's a BURN MARK on the lower left calf of the victim. We've seen such a mark before, on another autopsy photo. MACKELWAY I've seen this before. FRAN Huh? He doesn't answer, just hurries to a thick BOX OF OTHER AUTOPSY FILES AND PHOTOS. Starts rifling through them... ...until he finds the one we've seen before. The body from Trenton. He extracts it. Eyes it. A confirmation... He lays the two PHOTOS side by side. Looks to Fran. MACKELWAY Same burn-mark. (she leans in) I saw it

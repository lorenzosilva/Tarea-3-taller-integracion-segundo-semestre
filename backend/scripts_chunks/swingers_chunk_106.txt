a parked Escort. LORRAINE Well... This is it. MIKE Listen. I had a great time. LORRAINE Me too. MIKE I would love to see you again sometime. LORRAINE I'll be around. MIKE That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you. LORRAINE Let me get a pen out of my car. (opens the door) Do you have something to write on? Mike hands her a business card. LORRAINE (looking at it) You're a comedian? MIKE Yeah. And an actor. LORRAINE I'll have to come see you sometime. MIKE If and when I get a real gig I'll call you. LORRAINE It's not going to well? MIKE When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan. LORRAINE Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career? MIKE ... Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into... LORRAINE Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it. (She writes her number on the card.) Can I have one of these?

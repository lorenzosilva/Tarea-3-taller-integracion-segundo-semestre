made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was. BILLY What are you talking about? It was an accident. RISA Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus... BILLY Risa, I serviced that bus. At the garage. There's nothing wrong with it. RISA ...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough. BILLY You believe that? RISA I have to. BILLY Why? RISA Because I have to. BILLY Well I don't. BILLY gets up to leave. RISA Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses? That she was wearing it when the bus crashed? BILLY Yes. RISA Why did you do that, Billy? BILLY You think that caused the accident, Risa? That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer. Or maybe they're the same thing. RISA is crying. BILLY opens the door. BILLY (CONT'D) You know what I'm going to miss? More than making love? It's the nights you couldn't get away from Wendell. It's the nights I'd sit in that chair for an hour.

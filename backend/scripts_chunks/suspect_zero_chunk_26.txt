Mackelway approaches. The Woman doesn't turn. CHARLTON Agent Mackelway. I was 'bout to introduce you, but I understand that won't be necessary. Mackelway doesn't get it... until the WOMAN turns. She is AGENT FRAN KULOK. 35, sharp, pretty when she allows herself to be. But with a guard that never comes down. Mackelway has some history with her, so he tries not to react. It takes some effort. CHARLTON (CONT'D) Seems your former office has decided we might need some help on this one. So they sent out Agent Kulok. FRAN Tom. MACKELWAY Fran. That was terse, from both of them. Charlton takes note. CHARLTON I guess we're skipping the tearful reunion. Have a seat, Tom. Mackelway sits opposite Fran. She folds her hands. MACKELWAY How's things back at the ranch? FRAN Movin' right along. That might've been a dig; Charlton can't tell. CHARLTON Okay. Whadda we know? FRAN Picked up a foot-print in the back seat of Speck's car, size-and-a-half bigger than Speck's. Just like that, Fran is piping up.

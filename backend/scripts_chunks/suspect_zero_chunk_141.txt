or female? FRAN Huh? MACKELWAY The autopsies. 85. FRAN Females - Logan, Utah; and Decatur, Alabama. (Neither city is represented with black pins on that map.) She slides over a packet of PHOTOS: two FEMALE VICTIMS, photographed in separate morgues - face up, face down, waist and above, waist and below, etc. Mackelway eyes them, then leaves the room. We STAY WITH FRAN... taking in that O'Ryan FBI file. It troubles her. Mackelway returns, carrying the 9-by-12 envelope that Katie gave to him. FRAN (CONT'D) (re: O'Ryan's file) So is this what happens when an agent spins out? He gets deleted? MACKELWAY Sometimes. The lucky ones get sent to Wichita Falls. She breathes out an ironic laugh. He hands over the envelope, opens it. Inside: that photo of Karen Sumpter. Mackelway didn't pay much attention to it before. Fran eyes the photo, then the vitals. MACKELWAY (CONT'D) Friend of the Receptionist, missing for about a year now. I told her I'd let her know if the body ever turned up. Fran

It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might... Mike smiles as the CAMERA PULLS BACK from the window and backwards down Franklin Avenue in a reverse of the first shot of the movie. The soundtrack kicks in with Sinatra's "Here's To The Losers".... FRANK Here's to those who love not too wisely, no, not too wisely, but too well... To the girl who sighs with envy when she hears that wedding bell... To the guy who'd throw a party if he knew someone to call... Here's to the losers... Bless them all... ...We rise and pass the glowing Hollywood sign. It's still a full moon... FRANK Here's to those who drink their dinners when that lady doesn't show... To the girls who wait for kisses underneath that mistletoe...

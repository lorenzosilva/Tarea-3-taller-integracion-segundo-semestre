and battered by the sharp, rocky ground. Finally, he shoots off an outcropping and free-falls for fifteen feet. Then it really gets bad. Clear plastic sheeting has been stretched across the hill to help control the erosion. To Stanley however, it is the world's largest Slip and Slide. He is no longer able to control, even badly, his descent. Now, he is flying down the cliff face, only the rocks and bushes that slam into his body, slows the descent. Roberts, above him, is doing little better. LONG SHOT ON CLIFF FACE As Stan and Roberts slide toward the eight lanes of blazing afternoon traffic on the PCH. Finally, Stan bounces onto the black-top road. He runs headlong into the traffic. CARS SCREECH, HORNS BLARING, as they slide into each other. Stanley does not lose the single-minded focus of escaping. Roberts, now at the bottom himself, watches as a CAR SLIDES sideways into Stan, flipping him over it. Stan, not stopping to feel the pain, runs across the hood of a freshly-stopped car.

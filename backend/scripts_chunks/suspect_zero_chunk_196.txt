O'Ryan turns, studies him. ...and hands him the gun. Just like that. Mackelway eyes it. O'Ryan doesn't say a word, just crosses back to Zero, and grabs that TIRE-IRON off the ground. O'Ryan's now standing right behind Zero, as: O'RYAN (at Mackelway) You have to understand: none of this was arbitrary. We were chosen, you and I. WHAP! O'Ryan just swung that tire-iron into Zero's rib cage. We hear bones crack, and air rushing from the guy's lungs. He drops to his knees, gasping. O'RYAN (CONT'D) I saw us here. You did too. THUMP! Another violent swing of that tire-iron, busting up the other side of Zero's torso. Now both sides of his rib-cage have shattered.

Butterflies flitter and dart from flower to flower. The blonde's name is SELENA. She is our ideal image of the girl next door, who grew up into a dynamite lady. Her current boyfriend follows along behind her, lugging a big wicker hamper from their pickup truck parked at the edge of the road. Selena finds a grassy spot under an old oak. and spreads out a red and white checked gingham cloth.. SELENA Over here George. It's the perfect spot. Nice view. George sets down the wicker basket and Selena starts to unpack a scrumptious picnic of home cooked food. She unpacks fried chicken, hard-boiled eggs, potato salad, cold beer and a big rich creamy-frosted devils food cake. GEORGE You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat. SELENA Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants. She hands him a chicken drumstick and a hard-boiled egg. GEORGE Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle

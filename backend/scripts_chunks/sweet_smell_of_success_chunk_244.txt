you, not that one true fact didn't come out of Sidney's mouth tonight: self-admittedly, he committed a vicious crime of jealousy against Steve Dallas! (pausing) Now we have to clear Dallas, don't we?...But I'll have to sacrifice him... (he indicates Sidney) ...to do it. (turning to Susan) Am I doing right? SUSAN She is looking at Hunsecker. HUNSECKER (O.S.) (over scene) Yes or no, Susie...? Slowly, Susan nods. REVERSE ANGLE SHOOTING ACROSS Susan onto Hunsecker. Hunsecker turns away from her and walks to the telephone. He picks it up and begins to speak. While the scene continues, we hear his voice off screen, speaking to the phone, saying: "This is J.J. Hunsecker. I want you to get a message through to Lieutenant Kello. Ask him to ring me back. It's urgent." Susan backs slowly away from Hunsecker. Then she turns into CAMERA, which TRACKS with her and includes Sidney. Susan looks at Sidney and then, ashamed, avoids his eye. But Sidney comes nearer to her. Susan is deeply distressed.

the table if you want me to change it. MIKE (hastily laying down the bills) Oh... right. The dealer lays out the bills such that the amount is visible to the camera encased in the black glass globe overhead. Trent and Mike look up at it open-mouthed like turkeys in the rain. DEALER Blacks? Mike's attention is recaptured by the dealer, but Trent continues trying to peer through the smoked glass. MIKE Huh? DEALER You want this in black chips. MIKE Sure, that'll be fine. The dealer chirps out an unintelligible formality and the PIT BOSS chirps the response. Trent's focus whips away from the camera as both he and Mike stare at the pit boss ten feet away. The dealer plunks down the measly THREE CHIPS which represent Mike's entire cash reserve. Not quite the effect he had hoped for. The swingers stare at the chips. The players stare at the swingers. The dealer stares at the pit boss. MIKE Do you have anything smaller? DEALER Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet.

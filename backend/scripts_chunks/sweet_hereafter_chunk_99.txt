You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board. We all did. SAM It's not enough. For hospital bills. For Nicole. BILLY I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids. (beat) That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other. This was a community. SAM I'm sorry. BILLY stares at SAM. BILLY I used to like it here. I used to care about what happened. Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away. MARY Billy, please. The children. BILLY The children. BILLY looks at SAM and MARY, s strange smile on his face. He moves to leave. He pauses at the door of the kitchen. BILLY (CONT'D) How is Nicole? Is she around?

ALEX Well, you look old enough to be a guard. ROBBIE Almost 16. I get my license in September. ALEX It's just that most of the guys on grounds are a little younger than you. Most guys your age that can swim are guards. ROBBIE Well, I just moved here. I guess I missed guard tryouts. You're a guard then? ALEX Oh, no no no. I work concessions...at Aokee's Surf and Snack Shack. It's just as well. The guards are mostly stuck up anyway. The rest of us are the ones who know how to have fun. ROBBIE Can't swim, huh? ALEX (smiling) Nope. ROBBIE (listening to speaker on post above) What is that? ALEX (mimicking his perception of surfers) Surf tunes, dude! Page 6 of 81 (back to his own voice) You'll get used to it. You'll get to where you miss it. I had to buy two CD's just to get through the winter. They are now at the front of the line. A teenage girl MELISSA is sitting at the table with papers and a clipboard. ALEX (CONT'D) (gesturing) Ahh. And here we have the fair Melissa, time clerk

is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates. MIKE This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland. TRENT You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money. The corridor empties into the equally kitch CASINO. MIKE This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps. TRENT That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby. MIKE They're all skanks. TRENT Baby, there are beautiful babies here. MIKE Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift. TRENT What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys. Trent contorts his face at a cute WAITRESS passing by with a tray of drinks. TRENT Arrrrg! The waitress cracks a smile as she crosses away. Mike is visibly embarrassed. MIKE Cut that shit out. TRENT She smiled baby. MIKE That's not cool. TRENT Did she, or did she not smile? MIKE It doesn't matter... TRENT I'm telling you, they love that shit.

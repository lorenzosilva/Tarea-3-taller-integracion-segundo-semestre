shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't? MIKE I know. I know. TRENT They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it. MIKE I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect... TRENT Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There aint nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party. The COFFEE SHOP WAITRESS approaches the table. She's cute, but not nearly as hot as Christy. WAITRESS Are you ready to order? MIKE Coffee... (points to Trent, who nods) Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right? WAITRESS That's right. MIKE I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment". It goes over like a lead balloon. WAITRESS And you?

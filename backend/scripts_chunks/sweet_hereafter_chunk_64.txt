BILLY opens the door. BILLY (CONT'D) You know what I'm going to miss? More than making love? It's the nights you couldn't get away from Wendell. It's the nights I'd sit in that chair for an hour. Smoking cigarettes and remembering my life before... BILLY stares at RISA painfully, then leaves. CUT TO EXT. GAS STATION -- NIGHT MITCHELL is videotaping the bus with a portable camcorder. The bus is badly damaged, though essentially intact. Most of the windows in the rear have gone. There is a ghostly quality to this image, as though the video light is searching through the remains of an ancient shipwreck. MITCHELL turns off the camcorder and stands in the silent night, absorbing the disturbing energy of the bus. He hears a truck approaching the garage from the distance. It's BILLY ANSEL. MITCHELL retreats to his parked car as BILLY stops his truck in front of the bus and steps out of the truck. BILLY leaves his headlights on, and they cast dark shadows over the inside passenger seats.

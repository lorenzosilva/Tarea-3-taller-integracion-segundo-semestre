them are six gladiators with swords and shields, marching. They are followed by one female lifeguard with a basket of rose petals. She is throwing them into the path of the next group to enter. Next we see six more guards dressed as slaves carrying COWBOY, who is sitting up on a First Aid backboard. HE is wearing laurel leaves and a toga, he is obviously Cesar. On the backboard is also the surfer king trophy. They all approach the area in front of the seated guards, and rearrange themselves so that COWBOY has a good view of the gladiators. The drummers count a cadence that sets the pace for a simulated battle between the gladiators. The simulated battle rages until three of the gladiators are on their knees before the three victorious gladiators. The victorious gladiators hold their swords over the fallen ones, and look to COWBOY for a yea or nay. COWBOY generously waves and makes a thumbs up signal, and the swords are put away. The seated lifeguards all raise their fists and shout.

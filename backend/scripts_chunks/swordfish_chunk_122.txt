a mic. 128 OMITTED 128 thru thru 132 132 99. 133 INT. BUS - DAY 133 We are moving through the city. Behind the bus, a huge caravan of police cars and SWAT trucks follow. GABRIEL Stan, c'mere. Stan slides out of the seat and walks to the front with Gabriel. All the hostages' eyes are on him. At the front he looks at Gabriel. GABRIEL Take a look. Cops block off side streets as the convoy, ala The Gauntlet, rolls through L.A. Gabriel seems to be in complete control, despite being surrounded by every law enforcement officer within a hundred miles. 133A INT. BUS - DAY 133A Stan turns to Gabriel, angry. He grabs him, pushing him. STANLEY How the fuck can you justify all this? GABRIEL You're not looking at the big picture. Gabriel pushes him backward against the hand rail. GABRIEL Stanley, here's a scenario. You have the power to cure all of the world's diseases. But the price for this is that you must kill a single, innocent child. Could you kill that child to save the world? STANLEY No.

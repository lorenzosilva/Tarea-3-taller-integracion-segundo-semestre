There are a half-dozen actors sitting on folding chairs outside the partition. They all resemble Caden, except one very tall one. Hazel steps around the partition. HAZEL Sammy Barnathan? Sammy Barnathan stands. He is the gaunt man we've seen following Caden. Hazel leads him to Caden. Caden stands. HAZEL (CONT'D)SAMMY This is Sammy Barnathan.I don't have a resume or picture. I've never worked as an actor. CADEN Good. Tell me why you're here. SAMMY I've been following you for twenty years. So I knew about this audition. Because I follow you. Caden, hiding is nervousness, nods. SAMMY (CONT'D) I've learned everything about you by following you. Hire me and you will see who you truly are. Caden stares at Sammy. Sammy stares back. There's fear in Caden's eyes but he doesn't drop his gaze. SAMMY (CONT'D) Peek-a-boo. Sammy transforms effortlessly into Caden.

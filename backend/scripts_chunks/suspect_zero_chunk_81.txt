another COMPOSITE ARTIST enters, tools in hand. Charlton sighs, frustrated. CHARLTON (CONT'D) (re: Composite Artist) Let's get you two started. Composite Artist is ready to begin... CUT TO: 69 INT. BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY 69 A lively Sunday Service. Lots of Baptists, singing a rousing spiritual. Music and praise filling the room. We move along the pews, until we came to the very back row... There, one man sits. Alone. Quiet. O'Ryan. Odd expression on his face - it's as if he can't hear this rousing music, or feel the power of this place. People in the next row are stomping their feet. Music soars. But O'Ryan just drops his head, slowly... and begins to WEEP in the middle of this boisterous congregation. Outside, an 18-WHEEL TRUCK can be heard, rumbling by with great force. No one else in here seems to hear it. But O'Ryan shuts his eyes tight, grieving, sobbing... 70 EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - CONTINUING 70 That TRUCK has just thundered by, leaving a swirl of debris in its wake.

ointment. Selena enters with the Elderly Man in the banker pinstripe. They all form a circle in the centre of the room. SELENA Let us begin. I invoke the rule of seven. OTHERS IN UNISON The Circle is complete. NIGEL You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena. SELENA We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft. INDIAN WOMAN But Superman has been away. SELENA It is not Superman I speak of, but his cousin Kara. She knows we exist.. ELDERLY MAN Then she must be destroyed. NIGEL How did she find out about us? ELDERLY MAN That is unimportant. Now that she knows, she will become curious and learn more. When she learns we plan to restore the ancient religion of this planet and avenge the centuries of persecution---she will try to stop us. BIANCA We must destroy her first. ERICA But how can we destroy her? SELENA By the Rite of Ultimate Power. One person must volunteer to take on the combined power of us all.

PLAY-AREA - RESUMING 148 We've stepped out of that SUBJECTIVE POV now. Kathleen grabs her infant, distraught, as another massive 18-WHEEL TRUCK blows by us in the distance... 149 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING 149 O'Ryan washes his face, eyes his reflection in the mirror, scrutinizing himself. 150 INT.

We are: 151 INT. FBI OFFICE - O'RYAN ROOM - LATE NIGHT 151 2:30 a.m. Mackelway is in here by himself, angry. He reaches into that box.

in BG, GREER moves to the PROJECTOR'S MONITOR SCREEN and taps a touchpad. ON SCREEN - STATIC. GREER REWINDS to POVs at the hard- core CLUB. FAST FORWARD to the ALLEY, making out with TUXEDO. This is a recording of recent experience, as seen through the eyes of the BLONDE. GREER switches to real-time. Tuxedo breaks the kiss and turns to look OS. TUXEDO (ON SCREEN) Get lost, meatbag. As Tuxedo turns back TO CAMERA, we hear a hideous ELECTRONIC SCREECH, Tuxedo's face contorts in pain... and his EYES BURST, fragments of GLASS and ELECTRONICS fly. The POV reels, we hear the Blonde's SCREAM-- and STATIC again fills the screen. GREER is disturbed by this, looks again at the unconscious, quivering face of the man in the chair. CUT TO: INT. D.C. SUBWAY - NIGHT A mostly empty car, scattered SURRIE PASSENGERS ride stiffly, zoned out, empty expressions... except for a long-haired DREAD, one of the anti-surrogate fanatics. He's disheveled, hippyish, SHOUTS into the empty faces of the surrogates.

SCHWARTZ What do you remember about the accident? NICOLE I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything. And that's all. I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all. Then I was in the hospital. SCHWARTZ smiles and makes some notes in his pad. He talks to MITCHELL without looking up. SCHWARTZ Do you have any questions, Mr. Stephens? MITCHELL stares silently at NICOLE for a long time. NICOLE (voice over) Daddy was leaning forward in his chair, his mouth half open, as if he wanted to say something. Like what, Daddy? Like 'What about my money?' NICOLE and SAM stare at each other. MITCHELL I have no questions. SCHWARTZ Thank you, Nicole. NICOLE wheels herself away. She passes MITCHELL. MITCHELL (in a low voice) You'd make a great poker player, kid. NICOLE wheels herself over to her father. NICOLE Let's go, Daddy.

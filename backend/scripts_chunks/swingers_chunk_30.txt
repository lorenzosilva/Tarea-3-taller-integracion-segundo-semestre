to Trent, who nods) Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right? WAITRESS That's right. MIKE I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment". It goes over like a lead balloon. WAITRESS And you? TRENT I'll have the Blackbeard over easy. WAITRESS I'll be back with the coffee. She takes the menus and goes. TRENT (genuinely) Nice, baby. MIKE I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head. TRENT Baby, you did fine. MIKE (disgusted with himself) "Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."... TRENT ...Baby... MIKE ... It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though... TRENT You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money. MIKE I hope so. (checks watch) We gotta go soon. TRENT Baby, relax.

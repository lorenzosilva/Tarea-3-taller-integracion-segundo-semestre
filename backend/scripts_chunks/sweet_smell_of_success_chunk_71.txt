boy tonight. He called you my fat friend. KELLO (mildly) I don't believe it. Instantly aware that J.J. is toying with Sidney, Kello offers his large hand to Sidney, who refuses it. SIDNEY I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town. KELLO (with a laugh) I call him the boy with the ice cream face! HUNSECKER (laughing) Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry! KELLO (modestly) Yeah, I got eyes. I put things together. HUNSECKER I remember ONCE when you didn't quite "put things together". Boy! Was the Mayor mad! The memory of something unpleasant clouds Kello's face. KELLO Citizens committees! I didn't mean to hit the boy that hard. Yeah, that's when a feller needed a friend and I won't forget his initials, J.J. The policeman in the car sticks his head out of the window. PHIL (to Hunsecker) She died twenty minutes ago, Mr. Hunsecker. They're still investigating. HUNSECKER (shaking his head with total dismissal) That's show business. Thanks, Phil. (to Kello) See you.

O'RYAN Because I don't wanna do this at 70 miles an hour. It could be dangerous. Speck finds the off-ramp. His breaths are shallow now. SPECK Please, Mister - what do you want from me? O'Ryan's face: a knowing grin fans across it... CUT TO: ...the face of VIRGIL RAY STARKEY, on a bulletin board. 5 INT. F.B.I. RESIDENT AGENCY - WICHITA FALLS - MORNING (SAME 5 DAY) We're looking at the F.B.I.'s "Ten Most-Wanted List." Starkey is #7 on it. He's 40, white. His crime are listed as rape, murder, kidnapping. THOMAS MACKELWAY stares at Starkey's image. At the eyes... Mackelway is 34, bred for success - bred for stardom in fact, a whiz at everything he's ever attempted. So what the hell is he doing in Wichita Falls, Texas...? EIGHT AGENTS, in cubicles, with a ring of outer offices. Quiet phones, lousy take-out options, hardly a dream gig. CHARLTON (O.S.) Got a spot set up for you, Tom. That's RICK CHARLTON: late 40's, thinning hair, friendly. Charlton heads around a corner. Mackelway follows.

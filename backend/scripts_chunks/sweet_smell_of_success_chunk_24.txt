Chico nods in the opposite direction towards the stairs. CHICO (unhelpfully) Yeah, he's around somewhere. Upstairs, maybe. SIDNEY (coldly, as he goes) Thanks. COURTYARD Steve and Susan are still embracing. Steve is exultantly proud and happy. STEVE (incoherent) This is big, you know. Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater. With the boys. Fred can call Millie and - SUSAN Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother... STEVE His sobering reaction shows this is something important. STEVE (gently) You haven't told him yet... SUSAN SUSAN I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.

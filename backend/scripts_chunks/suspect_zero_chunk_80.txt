But you figured you'd get a bigger pat on the head if you wrapped this whole thing up without any help - is that it? The truth? Charlton has him pegged. But: FRAN Sir, I'm the one who took the call. Agent Mackelway was acting under the assumption that I'd already checked the guy out. We're both to blame. Hold it. That was a major exaggeration, if not an outright lie. Mackelway eyes her, thrown. She's poker-faced. Charlton, however, seems unmoved... CHARLTON Did Agent Mackelway attend the interview unaccompanied? FRAN (reluctantly) Yes, Sir. CHARLTON Then whose fuck-up is it? Mackelway eyes her: "Thanks for trying." She nods. 48. MACKELWAY (at Charlton) It was... poor judgment, Sir. CHARLTON You wanna work alone, start your own agency. Mackelway can do nothing but nod. Then, bailing him out, another COMPOSITE ARTIST enters, tools in hand. Charlton sighs, frustrated. CHARLTON (CONT'D) (re: Composite Artist) Let's get you two started. Composite Artist is ready to begin... CUT TO: 69 INT.

The concessions kids and AOKEE are very enthusiastic. They can see they have a chance with ROBBIE. PIPEMAN is watching from a far corner. MELINDA begins her second run. She is a little more confident this time, but still seems barely able to stand and ride the wave. More polite applause, and the big screen shows a 5. COWBOY catches his wave, and tries to imitate ROBBIE'S more aggressive style, but falls midway through the run. We hear a large gasp from the crowd as this happens. The crowd applauds politely, and the guards are supportive but disappointed. We see the JUDGES confer and the big screen shows a 0. ROBBIE gets his wave, and surfs it aggressively again, this time not nearly falling at all. The JUDGES nod approvingly and confer. The big screen shows a 9. The crowd goes wild,

2006 - NIGHT 33 Performance in progress. There is now a cemetery on stage. Linda, Biff, and other characters stand around a gravesite. Caden sits in the audience between Adele and Maria and his parents. He glances over at Adele's stony face. Maria is drunk and blurry. DAVIS (AS BIFF) Let's go, Mom. CLAIRE (AS LINDA) I'll be with you in a minute. Go on, Charley. I want to, just a minute. The other characters exit the stage. CLAIRE (AS LINDA) (CONTâ€™D) (talking to the grave) I never had a chance to say good- bye. Forgive me, dear. I can't cry. (begins to cry) I don't understand it; I can't cry. It seems to me that you're just on another trip. I keep expecting you. Willy, dear, why did you do it? I search and search and I search, and I can 't understand it, Willy. I made the last payment on the house today. Today, dear. And there'll be nobody home. We're free and clearâ€¦ We're freeâ€¦ We're freeâ€¦ We're freeâ€¦ (CONTINUED) SYN, NY - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - JULY 30, 2007 29A. 33

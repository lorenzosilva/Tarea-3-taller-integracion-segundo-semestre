MIKE What's dumb about it? ROB Well, you're doing so well... MIKE How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing? ROB At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy... MIKE They turned you down? ROB They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job. Mike lets it sink in. ROB See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too... MIKE I didn't make it... ROB That's your problem, man. You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. Those guys

shows an 8. ROBBIE snags his wave and rides it aggressively again, but loses his balance momentarily. It costs him; the JUDGES confer and the screen shows a 7. The concessions kids applaud, and the point totals show "Grounds 98", "Concessions 102" and "Lifeguards 102". EVERYONE is confused, there has never been a tie before. THE JUDGES Are flipping through papers, and BIG MIKE steps up to the microphone. BIG MIKE (clearing his throat, flustered) It looks like we have a tie. This has never happened before, but I seem to remember we provided for this possibility in the rules. Hopefully our judges can help us figure out what to do! The HEAD JUDGE is reading to the other JUDGES out loud, slaps his hand on one of the papers and comes up to the mike. HEAD JUDGE Reading from the rules, "...in the event of a tie at the end of three heats in the surf competition, the teams who are tied will participate in a sudden-death surf off. Additional heats will be run until a winner can be declared."

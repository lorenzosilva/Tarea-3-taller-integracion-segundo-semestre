Sir? An agent can just be deleted? CHARLTON Looks like it. Mackelway pauses. It's a depressing reality... MACKELWAY I couldn't understand it before - pushing Speck's car onto the state line. Makes sense now. He wanted to make the case Federal. He's drawing us in. CHARLTON Why would he do that? MACKELWAY So we'd be paying attention when he found Suspect Zero. CHARLTON Ya know what? I'm getting extremely tired of hearing that word. In fact, that's gonna be policy from now on. No Zero. MACKELWAY Sir, profile the guy. He's straight outta Quantico. All he's doing is working a case, like we would. He's not kidnapping little kids - he's chasing the guy who's doing the kidnapping! Look at the map! 80. CHARLTON What're you saying - that all these abductions are the work of one guy? Do you know how fucking insane that is?! (over Mackelway) Not let's try something that actually makes sense: He sends in these faxes, picks off three scumbags. For what?! So we'll think exactly what you're thinking

SEE in a far corner of AOKEE's TIFFANY and ROBBIE in an Page 59 of 81 animated, engaging conversation. AOKEE (CONT'D) Second time this week. Our boy Big Man on Campus, huh? ALEX Big something. I hope he knows how to work without a net. AOKEE Well. We all grow up sometime. He not drop a tray of dishes in days. Something going right. You think he ready? ALEX I guess we'll both find out on Sunday. I sure hope so. WE SEE TIFFANY and ROBBIE again, and TIFFANY is laughing loudly at some joke ROBBIE has made. 57 EXT NEAR SUNSET - TIME SHACK 57 ROBBIE, ALEX, AMY and KATIE are clocking out for the day. ROBBIE clocks out first. TIFFANY drives up in her convertible. TIFFANY (waving him over) Robbie! ROBBIE goes over to talk to her. WE SEE him go around to the passenger side. ROBBIE (shouting) Alex! I won't need a ride tonight after all. Tiff's taking me home! ROBBIE jumps in and they drive away. ALEX, AMY and KATIE are still standing on the porch of the TIME SHACK, shocked at what they've seen.

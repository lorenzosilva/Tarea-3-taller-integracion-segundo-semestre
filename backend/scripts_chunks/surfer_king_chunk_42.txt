shot of SKEETER and SNITCH. The WAVE BABE walks past them carrying a board, but we don't see below her waist, the board obscures our view. SNITCH sees, and freezes, dumbstruck. SKEETER is looking down at the grate where THE WAVE water drains. He reaches down and pulls something out, and turns to the WAVE BABE walking away. SKEETER (unaffected) Excuse me... Miss? (louder) Hello...excuse me...? Finally she turns. We see her, but just a flash of her from the back, as the board covers her waist area. She is puzzled by this grounds kid. SKEETER (CONT'D) (holding up the bottom to her swimsuit) Is this yours? She looks down behind the board and reacts. She bites her lower lip, winces and nods yes. SKEETER hands her her swimsuit, and she looks around and backs away towards a towel hanging from the fence nearby. SNITCH is still frozen, stunned by what he's just seen, mouth wide open. SKEETER waves his hand in front of SNITCH's face. No reaction. He's never seen a naked girl before. We're back

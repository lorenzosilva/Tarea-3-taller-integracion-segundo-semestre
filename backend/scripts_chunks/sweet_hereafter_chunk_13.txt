more time at the Spread Eagle... MITCHELL That's the local bar? RISA (nodding) ...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and... RISA hesitates. WENDELL Taking it out on her. MITCHELL stops taking notes, and looks at the WALKERS. MITCHELL He beat her? RISA nods. MITCHELL crosses the LAMBSTONS off of his list. He looks up at RISA and WENDELL. MITCHELL (CONT'D) You see, to do this right, to actually have a chance at winning - of getting some money to compensate you for the loss of your boy - we need folks like you. Sensitive, loving parents. People with no criminal background or history of trouble in town. Do you understand? The WALKERS nod. MITCHELL (CONT'D) Now, of all these parents you've told me about whose kids were killed, who would you consider to be good upstanding neighbors? RISA stares hard at MITCHELL. RISA What do you mean? MITCHELL People who will help our cause. Pause. RISA Well, there's the Hamiltons. Joe and Shelly Hamilton.

COWBOY also makes his way up there, and we see him talking to BIG MIKE. BIG MIKE nods in agreement and COWBOY goes to the mike as the crowd settles down.

COWBOY shakes ROBBIE's hand, and ROBBIE speaks at the mike. ROBBIE (holding trophy) I just want to thank Aokee, Alex and Katie for all their support. We see KATIE clapping, crying. AOKEE and ALEX are clapping and

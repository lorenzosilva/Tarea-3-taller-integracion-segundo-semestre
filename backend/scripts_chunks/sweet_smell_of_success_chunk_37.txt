Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again... (turning to Sidney) I wish you and Steve could like each other. SIDNEY (grimacing) We stick in each others craw. SUSAN Yes, but why? SIDNEY Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster. SUSAN Quizzically, she studies Sidney. SUSAN Don't you? SIDNEY He looks up sharply, (he is momentarily startled at Susan's insight.) Swiftly, he assumes a protesting air. SIDNEY Susie, your brother's one of my best friends, and - RESUME SUSAN She is not totally convinced by this performance. She smiles skeptically. SUSAN I know.

SIDNEY Where do you come off to make a remark like that?

HAZEL You're not going to make it, baby. 26INT. HAZEL'S BATHROOM (APARTMENT) - 2006 - NIGHT 26 Hazel takes off her make-up, hair back in a clip. She watches herself blankly in the mirror, somewhat erased without eye make-up. The run-over dog is sleeping in a box on the floor. 27INT. QUINCY'S, BACK ROOM - 2006 - ABOUT DAWN 27 The party has thinned out. The remaining people are sitting around a table, drinking. Claire, next to Caden, rests her head, sleepily drunk, against his shoulder. Caden studies a series of lumps under the skin of his arm. CLAIRE What are you going to do now? CADEN I'm going to Berlin for a month for my wife's show. Then I don't know. CLAIRE I wish I was your wife or a wife or had a wife. Or was German even. I'm so lonely with none of those things. A man walks in with a bunch of newspapers.

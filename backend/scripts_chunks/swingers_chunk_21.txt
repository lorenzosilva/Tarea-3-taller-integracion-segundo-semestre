all around, except for the swingers who watch their chips slide away in silence. Mike breaks the spell with a plucky smile from the pit of his stomach. MIKE (to the pit boss) Sure could use some dinner about now. SMASH CUT TO: Trent and Mike are wedged between the BLUEHAIR and the BIKER At the FIVE DOLLAR TABLE. They share a pile of red chips. TRENT I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven. MIKE Yeah? Well obviously not always! TRENT Always, baby. MIKE I'm just saying, not in this particular case. TRENT Always. MIKE But I lost! How can you say always?!? In the meantime, the Bluehair has been dealt an eleven. This captures the swinger's attention. BLUEHAIR Hit. Four. Fifteen all together. BLUEHAIR Oh... I don't know... Hit. Two. Seventeen. Dealer has a seven showing. BLUEHAIR What the hell- hit. Four! Twenty one. DEALER (with a warm smile) Twenty one. Polite applause from around the table which the Bluehair humbly waves off. Mike looks at Trent. Daggers. Trent shrugs.

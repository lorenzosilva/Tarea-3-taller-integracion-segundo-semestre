in L.A. again? STANLEY I told you -- ROBERTS -- vacationing. That's right. Ya know it's funny. Axl Torvalds was just here for a vacation, too. Isn't it odd that the two best hackers in the world are here at the same time. STANLEY I'm a sucker for Disneyland. (getting up) Tell Torvalds I said hello. ROBERTS If you're not careful you can tell him yourself. He's dead. Stanley looks at Roberts. ROBERTS (to his men) Give him a card. They do. Stan looks at it. ROBERTS In case you think of anything else you want to tell me. Stan turns to walk off. STANLEY (to the agent he elbowed) Sorry about your nose. ROBERTS Hey, Stan. Stan turns. ROBERTS You know, you're in way over your head here. (CONTINUED) 54. 69 CONTINUED: (3) 69 STANLEY (walking off) I know. ROBERTS It's a long walk back up the hill, Stanley. You want us to give you a lift? Stan lifts his middle finger behind him and begins the long journey back up the hill. Roberts collapses into the passenger seat. ROBERTS Follow him. RANDOM

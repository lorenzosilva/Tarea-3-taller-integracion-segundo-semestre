He grabs the box. Sure enough, that bucket once held red paint - same color O'Ryan used to cover that wall. There's also a bucket of BLACK PAINT here. And some used brushes. Mackelway brings the box into the meager light. We get a look INSIDE IT now. So does Dyson. Inside, beneath the paint-buckets, we see a few TV GUIDES, a yo-yo, a football. Then a BOOK on TRIBAL RITUAL AND TRANCE. Mackelway grabs it, eyes it. He flips through a few pages - odd images: a TRIBESMAN with eyes rolling back in his head, strange rites, etc. Mackelway sets the book down. Then, amidst the other materials in this box, he spots a large folded MAP. He grabs it, begins to unfold it. We see that this map's been written on, in pen. Cities on it have been CIRCLED. But before we can get a good look at it, Mackelway spots something else, at the bottom of this box, a shocker: A photograph of himself. It takes him a second to realize what he's looking at. But there it is, a NEWSPAPER PHOTO, of Agent Thomas Mackelway.

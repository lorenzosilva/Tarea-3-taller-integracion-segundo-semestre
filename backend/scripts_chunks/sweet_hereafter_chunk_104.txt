about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning? NICOLE Like what? I mean, I don't remember a lot. ANGLE ON MITCHELL MITCHELL I object to the form of that question. Note that. SCHWARTZ Was the bus on time? NICOLE Yes. SCHWARTZ And where did you sit that morning? NICOLE My usual place. On the right side. The first seat. SCHWARTZ And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning? NICOLE Until the accident? No. (beat) Yes, there was. ANGLE ON MITCHELL Worried about this new information. NICOLE (CONT'D) It was when Sean Walker got on. He was crying and didn't want to leave his mother. Mason Ansel was sitting beside me. I asked him to move, so I could quiet Sean down. When the bus started up, a car came around the corner and almost hit Sean's mother. She was okay, but it really scared Sean, because he watched it out the window. SCHWARTZ And was this incident caused in any way by anything the driver of the bus did? Pause.

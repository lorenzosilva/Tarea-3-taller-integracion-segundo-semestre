GREER, face red, out of breath, is displaying his badge to the CLERK, who checks his computer. (CONTINUED) 103. CONTINUED: CLERK I'm sorry, you're not on his list. GREER I wouldn't be. I'm here to arrest him. ARMANDO moves closer at this. CLERK I see... do you have a warrant? GREER Listen to me. Dr. Canter is committing a crime via surrogate-- right now. If you don't cooperate and let me up there, you become an accomplice. CLERK Without a warrant, I'm afraid I can't help you. ARMANDO takes Greer by the arm in a painful grip. ARMANDO You're gonna have to leave, sir. Armando escorts Greer none too gently to the door. GREER Ow! Easy, I'm only human. As Armando relaxes his grip a bit, GREER flexes his left arm-- then gasps and clutches his chest, as if having a coronary. He stumbles, falls to his knees. Armando bends over him-- ARMANDO Are you OK? Greer suddenly thrusts his hand beneath the man's jacket. Armando reacts, begins to struggle with Greer-- BANG BANG beneath his suitcoat.

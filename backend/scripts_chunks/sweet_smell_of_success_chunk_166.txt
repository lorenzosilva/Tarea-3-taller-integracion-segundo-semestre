I'm afraid I can't cope with them. REVERSE ANGLE Susan in foreground, Steve, Hunsecker and Sidney beyond. STEVE (CONT'D) (simply) You're too shrewd for me so I'll just be honest. Susie and I love each other, if I'm not mistaken, and we want to get married. Hunsecker pauses; Sidney throws in a stage whisper: SIDNEY Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous! STEVE Why don't we hear what Susie has to say? HUNSECKER (sardonically) That's stout of you, Dallas, but Susie may not care to air her dismal views in public... Steve walks to Susie, trying to lift her with his hopes and air of gentle urging and support. STEVE Susie...? SUSAN She stares at the floor. RESUME REVERSE ANGLE Hunsecker doesn't like the drift of things; his mouth tightens and he speaks to Susan with veiled warning: HUNSECKER Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks. Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear. STEVE Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?

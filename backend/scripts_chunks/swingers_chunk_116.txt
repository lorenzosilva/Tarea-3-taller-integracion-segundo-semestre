pass the glowing Hollywood sign. It's still a full moon... FRANK Here's to those who drink their dinners when that lady doesn't show... To the girls who wait for kisses underneath that mistletoe... To the lonely summer lovers when the leaves begin to fall... Here's to the losers... Bless them all... .... Past the blinking red beacon of the Capital Records building... FRANK Hey Tom, Dick and Harry... Come in out of the rain... Those torches you carry... Must be drowned in champagne... ... Up and over Hollywood Boulevard. High above the city... FRANK Here's the last toast of the evening... Here's to those who still believe... All the losers will be winners... All the givers shall receive... Here's to trouble-free tomorrows... May your sorrows all be small... Here's to the losers... Bless them all. ... It's all just a pool of beautiful golden light. FADE TO BLACK.

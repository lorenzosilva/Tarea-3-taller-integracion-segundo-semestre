-- Anthony's knees buckle-- The Beadle then SLAMS Anthony across the back of the neck -- Anthony falls hard-- The Beadle then uses one dainty foot to roll Anthony over-- Anthony gazes up at him, panting for breath, in agony-- BEADLE You heard Judge Turpin, little man. He presses the end of his billyclub into Anthony's forehead, grinding it hard-- BEADLE Next time it'll be your pretty brains all over the pavement. With that, the Beadle returns to the mansion and slams the door. Anthony slowly pulls himself to his knees, doubled over, coughing up blood. A long beat as Anthony gets his breath, wiping blood from his face. Still doubled over, he sings with burning intensity: ANTHONY I'll steal you, Johanna, I'll steal you! Do they think that walls can hide you? Even now I'm at your window. I am in the dark beside you, Buried sweetly in your yellow hair. He pulls himself up, every movement is agony. He makes his way down the alley, leaning on the wall for support. 20 EXT. EXCLUSIVE STREET

"THE ALL-AMERICAN DINER" - GAINESVILLE TEXAS - CONTINUING 2 (4:30 A.M.) HAROLD SPECK sits: mid 40's, pleasant face. A family man. Reads "Rod and Reel" magazine. Has a SALESMAN'S CASE by his side. Around him is a TRUCK-STOP in twilight: Truckers at the counter, Elvis on the wall, a "Drink Bud!" mirror. The WORLD SERIES can be heard on a RADIO... DOLLY (O.S.) Top that off for ya, Hon? That's DOLLY, a waitress, (50, been here too long.) Speck looks up, smiles thinly, "No." Dolly heads off. Speck returns to his article, underlining a particular passage. ...until a MAN seats himself, suddenly, in the seat opposite Speck's. Speck reacts, startled. SPECK Jesus... The MAN's name is O'RYAN. We only see PIECES of him: his eyes, his hands, a stain on his parka... O'RYAN What's in the case? SPECK I'm sorry? O'RYAN You're always lugging that case around.

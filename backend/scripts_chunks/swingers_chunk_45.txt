far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie... MIKE ... a day... TRENT ... Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing? MIKE Selling scrap metal. TRENT (smiles) See? And what does this guy she's with do? MIKE He drives a carriage. TRENT What?!? MIKE (smiling) I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something. TRENT Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey? MIKE I hear she's getting real fat. TRENT Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off. Trent cranks some Frank. "You Make Me Feel So Young". Mike is finally, genuinely, smiling. He turns down the music enough to talk. MIKE I'm gonna try. I'm really gonna try. Trent just smiles and cranks Frank back up 27 EXT. DESERT ROAD - SAME 27 Trent's car drives off into the distance. A sign reads: "Los Angeles - 270 miles". DISSOLVE TO: 28 EXT.

Coke cans, Twinkie wrappers... in that bed of untended weeds. A hollow Texas wind blows through it all. We stay with the carton... Then that hollow wind gains speed... and a deep RUMBLE grows in the distance, becoming a ROAR. The yellowed newspaper lifts off and whips past us. ...as an 18-WHEEL MACK TRUCK blows by, just a blur in the corner of our frame, doing 75 in the pre-dawn darkness. Then, the truck is gone, and the rush of air dissipates. The milk carton, the coke cans... they lie undisturbed. A LIGHT RAIN begins to fall... and some of the grime washes away from that milk carton, revealing a face. A child. "Have You Seen Me?" It's heartbreaking. TILT UP... to take in the vast flatness of Texas' I-35: concrete forever. In the distance, gray highway yields to black STORMCLOUDS gathering silently over endless prairie. A vertical vein of LIGHTNING streaks through one of them. CUT TO: ...a spoon, stirring a cup of coffee. 2. 2 INT. "THE ALL-AMERICAN DINER" - GAINESVILLE TEXAS -

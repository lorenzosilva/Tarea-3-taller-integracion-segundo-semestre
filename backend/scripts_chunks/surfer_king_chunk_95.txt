COWBOY has binoculars and is looking through them. COWBOY He's pretty good, I'll give him that. TIFFANY (concerned) How good? COWBOY If I have an off day, he could win. TIFFANY (really concerned) That's terrible. You're the Surfer King. COWBOY Well, some days you get the wave, and some days the wave gets you. TIFFANY This can't happen. What are we gonna do? COWBOY I don't know what you're going to do, but as me for me, I'm gonna schedule some practice time of my own. TIFFANY This may take a lot more than extra practice. COWBOY Well, I don't know what else you expect. I'll go out and do my best. If that's not enough, it's not enough. TIFFANY grabs the binoculars and stares down at Thunder Bay. WE SEE gears turning in her head. 55 EXT. MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK 55 ROBBIE and Alex are walking by. JAFFA sees them. JAFFA Page 57 of 81 Hey, surfer boy!

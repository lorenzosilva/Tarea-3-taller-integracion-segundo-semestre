Inside, nothing incriminating: a sweater, some old junk, two trophies. Dyson eyes him: "See?" Mackelway nods. Dyson shuts the locker. Mackelway looks to that wall: 1,000 copies of the circle-with- a-slash-through-it. No idea what they signify... DYSON (CONT'D) He painted one of the walls in his room, too.

HOSPITAL - 2008 - NIGHT51 Caden waits on a plastic chair in a dimly lit hallway, his beat-up suitcase at his feet. He reads a very old Vogue and opens to a spread about his wife. She seems glamorous. There are photos of her in Berlin, her work, her flat. She is the toast of the art world. Photos of her with two men, and also with Olive, who seems somewhat Nazi Youth-like now. NURSE Mr. Cotard? He looks up, having forgotten where he was. He grabs his suitcase and follows the nurse down a dismal hallway: gurneys against dirty walls, empty wheelchairs. Skinny man takes a flash picture of Caden. Nurses drinking coffee out of paper cups eye him. Puddles of vomit on the floor. They arrive at the end of the hall. A doctor pokes his head out of a room. He studies a file and doesn't look up. DOCTOR Mr. Cotard? 52INT. SMALL EXAMINING ROOM - 2008 -

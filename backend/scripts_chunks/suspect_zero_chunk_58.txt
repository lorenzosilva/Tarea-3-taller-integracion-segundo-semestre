In America animals have rights. (pointedly) Don't they, Virgil? STARKEY How the fuck should I know? O'Ryan half-smiles, then kicks Starkey right in the head. Loretta's eyes go wide. Another kick follows, to the ribs. Then one to the groin. Then: 35. O'RYAN (at Loretta) Turn around. He said that without looking at her. But he can tell that she hasn't moved - too frightened. So he eyes her. O'RYAN (CONT'D) (again) Turn around! She turns away, lying face down on the seat, covering her head. No idea what kind of terror is to come next. We STAY WITH HER... able only to hear what follows: The sound is animal, awful - like a pig being gutted - a horrible SQUEAL, covering the GRUNTS coming from O'Ryan. In goes the knife again, prompting another agonized cry from Starkey. Loretta's crying too: from fear, shock... She keeps her face buried, shutting her eyes tight. The sounds of savagery fill the night. Then, one last gasp from Starkey... followed by an awful silence... and the assault is over.

Attention please. Will Mr. John Big Bootay report to Lost River Splashdown. John Big-Bootay to Lost River Splashdown. ALEX (to ROBBIE) He's calling for security. ALEX wanders off a moment, looking at something going on in the distance. Page 27 of 81 ROBBIE (to JAFFA) Wow. Jamaica. I thought I was far from home. JAFFA (dropping the accent a bit) I'll let you in on a little secret. Perception is everything...now, Jamal from Aurora, he's probably over with those guys... WE SEE SKEETER and SNITCH walking into the men's room, looking suspiciously around. JAFFA (CONT'D) (back to the accent) ...cleaning the rest rooms. But Jaffa from Jamaica, he's in customer service, wearin' the nice shirt and playing the music. Perception and atmosphere. You get it? ROBBIE smiles and nods, and waves goodbye to catch up with ALEX. 21 INT - MOMENTS LATER - IN MEN'S CHANGING/REST ROOM 21 SNITCH is filling up a water balloon, while SKEETER is tying a piece of fishing line to the hook on the inside of the stall

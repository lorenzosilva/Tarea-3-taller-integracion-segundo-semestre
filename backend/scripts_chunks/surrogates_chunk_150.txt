(the surrie) is holding BOBBY at GUNPOINT, a grim expression on her face. She doesn't realize Bobby's on the phone. GREER (FILTER) (CONT'D) Hello? Bobby, are you there? Bobby looks toward the special TERMINAL that displays the surrie serial numbers. NUMBERS are cranking through fast, ALL HIGHLIGHTING. Bobby looks at Peters, but speaks for Greer's benefit. BOBBY Peters, have you gone insane? Put the gun away, what the hell are you trying to prove? PETERS ignores him, watching the TERMINAL SCREEN. WIDER now, we see that all the SURRIE WATCHERS have disconnected, they're stationary on their tracks. THE GLOWING MONITORS remain on, showing random scenes, unwatched. MOVEMENT at the elevated entrance-- --PETERS spins and FIRES HER HANDGUN in that direction. The intruder retreats. We now see a couple of SURRIES have already been dropped here, sprawled on the staircase leading down, bullets in their heads. PETERS spins on Bobby, who's WHISPERING frantically into HIS HEADSET: BOBBY (CONT'D)

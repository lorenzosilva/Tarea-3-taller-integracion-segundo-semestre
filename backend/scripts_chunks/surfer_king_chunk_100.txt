I won't need a ride tonight after all. Tiff's taking me home! ROBBIE jumps in and they drive away. ALEX, AMY and KATIE are still standing on the porch of the TIME SHACK, shocked at what they've seen. ALEX (disbelief) Tiff? AMY (grossed out) Tiff? KATIE (forlorn, stunned) Tiff. WE SEE ROBBIE and TIFFANY drive out the gate. We see KATIE walk slowly out of the park alone. As she is walking, we flash back to scenes of KATIE and Page 60 of 81 ROBBIE together, dancing and laughing. This time the dance moves to the song of Allison Krause's "New Favorite". We take a final look at KATIE with the setting sun at her back and see she is crying. 58 EXT.

the face. GABRIEL Goddamit. I knew it. Gabriel walks back to one of the burning Suburbans where Stanley stands. GABRIEL Get in the fucking car, Stanley. STANLEY I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. Gabriel pulls out his H&K, points it at Stanley. GABRIEL You're on my good side and you want to stay there. Stanley, I like you, but don't confuse kindness with weakness. So, get in the fuckin' car. I need my hydra. FADE TO BLACK. FADE IN: 93 OMITTED 93 70. 94 INT. GABRIEL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 94 Stanley is working at his terminal. GINGER Stanley? You alright? STANLEY What do you think? I just watched that maniac murder ten men in the street. I'm just fucking great. It doesn't matter if I get my daughter back if I'm dead. Even if I do survive this, who's gonna keep me out of jail? You? She walks over to him and kneels down, places her hand on his leg, looks up at him. GINGER I won't let anything happen to you, Stanley. You have to trust me. STANLEY Trust you?

(pressing the clicker) Get ready. A wave comes and ROBBIE begins paddling. He misses it, Page 53 of 81 splashes the water angrily and turns back to paddle to position again. AOKEE and ALEX look at each other nervously. PIPEMAN (CONT'D) Want to know what you did wrong? ROBBIE (mad) Just gimme another wave. PIPEMAN Oakey doakey. Another wave comes. ROBBIE paddles furiously and misses it again. Now he's really angry. ROBBIE (tersely) Okay. Please. Tell me what I did wrong. PIPEMAN You're in the wrong position. The wave doesn't crest that soon. Move ten feet further away from the back wall. ROBBIE (to himself) The ocean never had a back wall. (to Pipeman) Thank you. ROBBIE paddles over to the spot suggested by PIPEMAN. AOKEE and ALEX are now sitting on the edge of the lawn chairs anxiously awaiting the next wave. It comes and ROBBIE catches it easily and begins riding it aggressively. He has a good run and kicks out at the end. AOKEE and ALEX high-five. ALEX AND AOKEE (together)

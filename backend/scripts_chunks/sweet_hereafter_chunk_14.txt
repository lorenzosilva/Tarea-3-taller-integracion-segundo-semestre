WENDELL (caustically) Yeah, right. Beat. MITCHELL looks at WENDELL, waiting for an explanation. WENDELL (CONT'D) I mean, everyone knows Joey steals antiques from summer cottages. Resells them to dealers in the city. He's been doing that for years. MITCHELL regards WENDELL with a slight smile of admiration. MITCHELL That's great, Wendell. That's the sort of thing I need to know. So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on. RISA There's the Prescots... WENDELL That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town. He's about to lose his house and car. RISA But Charlene... WENDELL Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night. Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts. MITCHELL is taking notes.

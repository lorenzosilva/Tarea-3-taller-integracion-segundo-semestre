This won't take long. Keep the motor running. INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. LATE AFTERNOON Selena strides down the hospital corridor almost as if she is floating an inch above the floor. Her huge silk cape billows around her, making her seem larger-than-life. Nurses, orderlies, patients scatter to get out of her way. Her presence is so formidable and she moves so fast and inexorably that no one has a chance to stop her and inquire what she's doing there. She knows exactly where she's going to. She turns a corner, and steps inside an open door and closes it behind her. INT. ETHAN'S ROOM. DAY He is sitting in bed, an ice bag on his head, drawing a picture of Supergirl on a piece of cardboard. He is in pajamas and robe. Selena steps beside the bed. He looks up. ETHAN Oh no, not you again. SELENA What an adorable hat. ETHAN They think I have a concussion. SELENA And you think you're in love. ETHAN I know it. SELENA This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.

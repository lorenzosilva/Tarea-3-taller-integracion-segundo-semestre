slick, eh? NICOLE Very slick. SAM Do you like the colour? NICOLE It's okay. SAM And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see. CUT TO INT. BURNELL HOME -- DAY Inside the house. The interior of the house is dark and somewhat tawdry. The BURNELL'S are almost poor. But SAM then leads NICOLE into the special room he has built for her. It seems like another world. Every detail has been lovingly attended to. No expense has been spared to make this room as attractive and inviting as possible. A room that a guilty, abusive father might dream up for his crippled daughter. SAM What do you think? Pause. NICOLE wheels around, trying to control her emotions as she inspects the room. A phone rings in the background. MARY goes to answer it. NICOLE fixes her gaze at the back of the door. NICOLE The door needs a lock. SAM (taken aback) Sure. I'll fix it right away. SAM goes to get his tools. JENNY stares at NICOLE. JENNY Can I come and visit you here? NICOLE You better. And you can sleep in my new bed

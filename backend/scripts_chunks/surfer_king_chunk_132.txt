had a tricks board with just a single fin and foot pockets. PIPEMAN We gotta pull the fin. What do we do about the foot pockets? ROBBIE You got duct tape? PIPEMAN reaches into his tool belt and pulls out a roll. PIPEMAN What kind of plumber would I be if I didn't have duct tape? Water World Page 76 of 81 Platinum! Where do you want them? They place the board on a table. ROBBIE pulls off two small pieces of tape and places them on the board. ROBBIE Here and here. PIPEMAN gets his screw gun out of his tool belt and begins removing the two outer fins of the board. He then begins looping duct tap around the board to create two foot pockets. This provides a background to the dialog below. AOKEE So, help me understand. What you do now? ROBBIE Pipeman is taking the extra fins off my board. I only need one to make a deep cut back. He is also putting some pockets to slip my feet into so when I flip upside down, I don't lose the board. ALEX Flip upside down? ROBBIE A back flip. You guys see it

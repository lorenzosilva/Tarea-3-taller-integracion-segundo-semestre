NICOLE The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame. MITCHELL There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole. Not in a situation like this. NICOLE You seem very sure about that. MITCHELL I'm absolutely positive. NICOLE turns to face SAM. She stares at him. NICOLE No matter what I'm asked, I'll tell the truth. SAM looks back, expressionless. MITCHELL That's fine. I want you to be absolutely truthful. And I'll be right there to advise and help you. And there'll be a court stenographer there to make a record of it, and that's what'll go to the judge, before the trial is set. It'll be the same for everybody. They'll be deposing the Ottos and the Walkers, the bus driver... NICOLE Dolores. MITCHELL Yes. Dolores...and even your mom and dad. But I'll make sure you go last. NICOLE Why? MITCHELL So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that? NICOLE nods. SAM When do they award damages? MITCHELL Depends.

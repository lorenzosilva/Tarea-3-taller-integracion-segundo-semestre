TO: 83 EXT. LONGHORN DINER WICHITA FALLS - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING 83 This is the lone source of light on an otherwise dark stretch of road. Mackelway's Yukon pulls up. 84 INT. LONGHORN DINER WICHITA FALLS - MOMENTS LATER 84 Hardly a sound in here. Mackelway stands at the register, paying for his TAKE-OUT. Another night with nothing but his thoughts for company. Great. Then: A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Agent Mackelway? It's Katie, the receptionist from his office - sitting by herself in a nearby booth. Mackelway smiles. KATIE (CONT'D) Hi. CUT TO: 85 INT. KATIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER NIGHT 85 Inexpensive, but furnished with all the touches that Mackelway's apartment lacks: flea-market stuff, lace, antique books, photos from other eras. Character. And candles. Lots of candles. They throw SHADOWS of Mackelway and Katie all over the walls. An odd MUSIC fills the room, coming from a BOOM-BOX on the floor. It's a rhythmic Navajo CHANT, with Native-American drums providing the pulse.

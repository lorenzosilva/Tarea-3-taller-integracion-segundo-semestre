Zaltar is continuing his climb, but the way is getting steeper, and he is tired and short of breath. He pauses. SUPERGIRL Why are you stopping? ZALTAR Stopping? Was I? Silly. One thing you musn't do. He continues forward, and upward, firming their path with the matterwand. The wand creates a warm circle of white light around them in contrast to the monochromatic energy field of the Phantom Zone. Because of the inherent curvature of the Phantom Zone vortex, they seem to be scrambling up a sheer vertical wall now. Supergirl is close beside Zaltar helping him along, not merely following as she had before. The throbbing sound of energy waves surging down the vortex is growing louder as they proceed. Zaltar stumbles, and drops the matterwand. ZALTAR Oh dear! The vortex starts to sweep the wand backwards, down to where they have just climbed from. Supergirl makes a desperate lunge and retrieves the wand as it sweeps past. But now she is being swept backwards. ZALTAR The wand. Use it.

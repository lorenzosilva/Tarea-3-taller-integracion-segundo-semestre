SCHWARTZ This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking? NICOLE Yes, I understand. SCHWARTZ Why were you scared? NICOLE Dolores was driving too fast. Silence. MITCHELL is watching his entire case crumble. SCHWARTZ Mrs. Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole? NICOLE The speedometer. And it was downhill there. SCHWARTZ You could see the speedometer? NICOLE Yes. I looked. I remember clearly now. It seemed we were going too fast down the hill. I was scared. NICOLE looks at MITCHELL, who stares back. SCHWARTZ How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going? To the best of your recollection? NICOLE Seventy-two miles an hour. SCHWARTZ Seventy-two miles an hour? You're sure of this? NICOLE Positive. SCHWARTZ You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles

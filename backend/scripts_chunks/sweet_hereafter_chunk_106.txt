the Marlowe Road at what's called Wilmot Springs? NICOLE Yes. NICOLE There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods. And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual. I remember that. I'm remembering it pretty clearly. SCHWARTZ (eyebrows raised) You are? NICOLE Yes. MITCHELL (worried) Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'. SCHWARTZ And what was the weather like at this time? NICOLE It was snowing. MITCHELL Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question. SCHWARTZ I will offer that report. Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else you observed at that time? NICOLE Before the actual accident? SCHWARTZ Yes. NICOLE stares at her father as she responds. NICOLE I was scared. SCHWARTZ Why were you scared? SCHWARTZ This is before the accident,

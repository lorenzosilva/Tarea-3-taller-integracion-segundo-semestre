noticed something: A NEIGHBOR-LADY, visible just over Speck's backyard fence, is looking right at him through her bedroom window. Fuck it. He enters the storm cellar. 95 INT. SPECK'S STORM CELLAR - CONTINUING 95 Seven steps, leading to a dusty cement floor. Mackelway looks around. 58. Facing him are the things a meticulous man would store in case of disaster: Cans of food, sternos, sleeping mats, drums of potable water. And long FOOT-LOCKERS. Two of them. That's where Mackelway's eyes go, instantly. He hurries to them. Throws one open. Nothing but sheets and blankets inside. He paws through it... finding nothing else. He throws the other trunk open. Inside? Pillows. Fuck. He slams it shut, looks to those cans of food, stacked on shelves. He approaches the shelves, jostling cans from their rows, making more noise than he ought to. But he finds nothing behind them... except more cans. He approaches those two huge drums of water, lugs them aside. Behind them is a tall CUPBOARD, locked.

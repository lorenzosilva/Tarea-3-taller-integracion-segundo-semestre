Would you shoot me? That's something Mackelway doesn't want to consider. MACKELWAY Put it down. O'RYAN (calmly) I want you to think for a second. About your destiny. Who you are. You're cursed, like I am - except you keep running from it. (Mackelway's silent) You hear things. You see things. That's why you can't sleep, why your head always aches. He turns. They are face to face. Nothing but that gun between them. O'RYAN (CONT'D) ...and it's why you are going to let me kill this animal. And then you're going to kill me. 120. That threw Mackelway badly. O'Ryan seizes the moment - wheeling around... He takes one last swing at Zero, like a lumberjack. The tire- iron impacts Zero's skull with a dull THUD, cracking it. He is dead. Mackelway's eyes go wide. Whole thing has been a blur. O'Ryan releases the tire-iron... and drops to his knees like a man awaiting execution, his back to Mackelway. Mackelway is silent. Stunned. The blood from Zero's caved-in skull finds its way to O'Ryan's knees.

SUSAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT CAMERA shoots across Susan in foreground; she is asleep, a tired, helpless, sweet kid. The figure of her brother is seen - a dark shape on the terrace outside.

The buildings are now dark, only a few of the electric signs are left on all night. CAMERA comes to rest looking over Hunsecker's shoulder; it tilts downward to a view of Broadway below, Duffy Square in the distance.

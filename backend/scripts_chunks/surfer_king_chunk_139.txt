time shack, "Thanks for another great year". ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY are clocking out for the final time this summer. They all stop and look around one final time. Suddenly TIFFANY drives up in her convertible. TIFFANY Another summer gone. How about it Robbie? You gonna guard next year? They could use your help. They all walk closer to her car. ROBBIE I don't know...we have a pretty good time at AOKEE's. TIFFANY You know, that's what I hear. Maybe I should work there next summer. ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY all say these lines pretty much at the same time. ROBBIE You wouldn't like it... ALEX That's a bad idea... KATIE And you're such a good guard... AMY You'd be miserable... TIFFANY Maybe you're right. See you around... EDDIE appears out of the time shack wearing his tuxedo t shirt. Page 80 of 81 EDDIE (almost singing) Tiffany! He walks up to her driver's side. TIFFANY (feeling charitable, warmly) Hello, Eddie. EDDIE shows there is nothing in his hands, then reaches into the car

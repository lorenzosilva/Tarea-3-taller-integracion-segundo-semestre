in the doorway. CHARLTON (CONT'D) O'Ryan was spotted there tonight. Took a squad-car and a side-arm from a State Trooper. 'Bout an hour later a five-year old boy was abducted, roughly a mile up the Interstate. It's 3 a.m. What's this guy doing here? CHARLTON (CONT'D) The vehicle was found in an abandoned lot. We're establishing a perimeter around the city now. 79. MACKELWAY (knows already) But the Trooper wasn't hurt... CHARLTON What makes you so sure? MACKELWAY Professional courtesy. Charlton's at a loss... until Mackelway gestures to the table, where he has laid out O'Ryan's entire FBI File. Every memo, citation, letter, i.d. picture. 150 pages. Charlton eyes it, calmly. He's not going to let his jaw drop, not with Mackelway watching. So he just nods. MACKELWAY (CONT'D) Is that... possible, Sir? An agent can just be deleted? CHARLTON Looks like it. Mackelway pauses. It's a depressing reality... MACKELWAY I couldn't understand it before - pushing Speck's car onto the state line.

Hunsecker would like to comfort her, but he dare not touch her again for fear of inviting another rebuff. He is deeply hurt and wounded. Embarrassed that Sidney should watch this moment, Hunsecker rises. To cover his emotion, he walks to the tray of drinks in background; he pours a brandy and comes back. Stooping, he offers it to Susan. Her only reaction is again to wrench herself away from him, facing the opposite direction. SUSAN (sobbing bitterly) GO AWAY! Hunsecker sets down the drink, stands up. HUNSECKER (in a choked voice) Talk to her, Sidney... SIDNEY (hushed) Talk to her yourself... Over scene the telephone rings. It is ignored. While Hunsecker looks down at the girl, helplessly, the telephone continues to ring. SUSAN A CLOSE UP. It is she who first becomes aware of the telephone. Her weeping has stopped now. Slowly, she raises her head. CAMERA EASES BACK to include Sidney beyond her; he notes this movement, seeing in it a revival of the girl's will to live; he is moved.

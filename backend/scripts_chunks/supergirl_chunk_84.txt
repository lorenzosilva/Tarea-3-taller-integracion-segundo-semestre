What an adorable hat. ETHAN They think I have a concussion. SELENA And you think you're in love. ETHAN I know it. SELENA This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion. ETHAN Why should I believe you? SELENA It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl. Ethan. reaches out and grabs her cloak with a grip of such urgency that she is pulled slightly off balance. ETHAN Then I'm not the only one who saw her. You did too! Selena pulls his hand away from her cloak. SELENA Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl? ETHAN But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion. SELENA Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first. Selena sits on the side of the bed. She removes a vial of liquid from her bodice. I saw you SELENA (continuing) Here. Drink this. It's an antidote to the love drug I gave you. Ethan sweeps it on the floor, where it shatters. He starts frantically ringing the buzzer pinned to his bed.

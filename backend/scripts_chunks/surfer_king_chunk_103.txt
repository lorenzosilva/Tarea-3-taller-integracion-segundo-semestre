They begin a routine practiced with brooms, in a cadence, clapped by the grounds kids behind them. LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D) What do you do if it's wet and not yours? MARCHERS (in cadence) Don't touch it! Don't touch it! LEAD MARCHER How do you deal with a full can of trash? MARCHERS We empty! We empty! LEAD MARCHER Sound off! MARCHERS Trash Rats! LEAD MARCHER Again! MARCHERS Trash Rats! LEAD MARCHER Sound off, Trash Rats. MARCHERS Trash rats! Trash Rats! They stop. Their brooms are raised over their heads. LEAD MARCHER Company! Brooms Ho! They allow their brooms to fall to their right side and march to the trash cans. They pull out bright blue ski masks, a la BLUE MAN GROUP, and pick up the toilet plungers. The lead marcher holds his plunger high and shouts. LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D) Company! Begin! He counts a four beat rhythm and they begin a BLUE MAN/STOMP like drum routine with the trash cans.

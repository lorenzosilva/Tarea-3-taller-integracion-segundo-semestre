the rest of this car, as: GRANGER (aloud) Hey Jumbo. Toss me down a crowbar. Granger's by the trunk. Before Mackelway can comment, Jumbo has tossed a CROWBAR down from the top of the embankment: a ten-pound hunk of iron, flying right at us. Everybody ducks... as it CLANGS on the roof of the Buick. Jumbo shrugs. JUMBO You said toss it. Mackelway shakes his head. "Shitkicker." Granger grabs the crowbar. He's just about to open the trunk as: MACKELWAY Hold it a second. Granger pauses. Mackelway crosses to the trunk, and snaps off a few shots with the Minox. Something catches his eye, along the line of the TRUNK. He kneels closer... An odd RESIDUE, crusty and hard, has formed a thin line on top of the paint in a single post. He takes out a VIAL, and scrapes some of the residue into it. Then he sniffs it. Pauses... MACKELWAY (CONT'D) Smells like... clove. He looks to Granger: now you can open the trunk. DYLAN (re: Mackelway) Where the hell'd you find this guy? 13. CHARLTON Field Office.

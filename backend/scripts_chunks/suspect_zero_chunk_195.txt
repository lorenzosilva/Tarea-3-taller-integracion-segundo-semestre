puts a bullet through Zero's left palm. That got Mackelway's attention. Zero howls with pain, his palm gushing. The TIRE-IRON falls to the ground. Mackelway approaches O'Ryan. MACKELWAY I'll take it from here. He extends his good hand to O'Ryan: "The gun." O'Ryan pauses. Then... O'RYAN Are you going to shoot him? MACKELWAY Give me the gun, O'Ryan. ZERO Hey, I just surrendered. O'RYAN Shut up. ZERO I surrendered! That's it! O'RYAN SHUT UP!!! O'Ryan wheels around, aiming the gun right at Zero's face. That shuts the guy up in a hurry. 118. From that service road now, we hear a line of SIRENS, approaching from a distance. Unit after unit. O'RYAN (CONT'D) (quietly now) Look at him, Mack. He's not human anymore. Go dig up that old lady's backyard - you'll find bodies there... Maybe hundreds of them. Of course, ya gotta get a warrant first, chain of custody's gotta be followed. One breach, and he walks. (no reply) My way, he's eliminated; the world is rid of him. It's a lot closer to justice

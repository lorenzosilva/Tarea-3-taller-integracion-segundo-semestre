Ethan's grip fails and he falls. EXT. CHIMNEY. SKY Supergirl appears, snatches Ethan in mid-air, and flies off with him into the clouds above. EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL Selena reacts with relief---then, realizing who has saved him, her face clouds with resentment. EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY Jimmy Olsen's magazine pops open and film unspools out of his camera as his motor drive whirrs. JIMMY Darn! He turns to Bianca, who is looking up in the sky from beside the Cadillac. JIMMY Hey lady, did you see that? Bianca gives him a glance of contempt. BIANCA See what? JIMMY The girl---dressed like Superman--caught that guy in mid-air. BIANCA Really? Maybe you should check into the hospital and have your head examined. EXT. HIGH IN THE AIR ABOVE THE HOSPITAL. SUNSET Supergirl carries Ethan beside her, her arm tight around his upper chest, his arm over her shoulders. They are above the clouds bathed in the rich warm glow of sunset. He looks at her ecstatically, his eyes drunk with love. ETHAN You're alive!

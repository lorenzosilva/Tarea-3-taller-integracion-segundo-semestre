the tire-iron... and drops to his knees like a man awaiting execution, his back to Mackelway. Mackelway is silent. Stunned. The blood from Zero's caved-in skull finds its way to O'Ryan's knees. But O'Ryan remains peaceful. Calm. Ready. MACKELWAY Get up. O'RYAN I can't do that, Mack. I've seen all this already. For months now. MACKELWAY Get up. O'RYAN Every time, we're in this field: same wind, same rain. And you... He puts a finger to his head, pretending it's a gun. Then he pretends to pull the trigger. Mackelway gets the idea. O'RYAN (CONT'D) It's okay. I want you to. I'm begging you to. Mackelway doesn't know what to do. Then, making matters worse: FRAN (O.S.) (aloud) Mack? She's about a hundred yards away... but she'll be here soon enough. That puts some heat under O'Ryan: O'RYAN I'm tired, Mack. FRAN (O.S.) Can you hear me? 121. She's 90 yards out now... O'RYAN Pull the trigger... (no reply) I'm not going to jail. Now pull the fucking trigger! Mackelway's frozen. O'Ryan knows it.

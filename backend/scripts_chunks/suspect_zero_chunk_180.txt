sits up. O'Ryan pulls over at: 188 EXT. RANCH-HOUSE - GREENVILLE, TEXAS - CONTINUING 188 We've seen this place before. That is, we've seen it in O'Ryan's DRAWING, which lies on the dashboard before us: A ranch-style house with a WINDMILL in the backyard. O'Ryan pulls over. Rain pounds on the roof and hood. Wind blows. Mackelway studies the house. Then his eyes shift briefly to the drawing. MACKELWAY Can't bring you in with me. You know that. O'Ryan shrugs, then raises his hands: "Cuff me." The CUFFS are lying on the floor in the back seat. Mackelway reaches back, to grab them... a golden opportunity for O'Ryan to club the guy. But O'Ryan remains still. Mackelway grabs them. Then he stops. Simply has to ask: MACKELWAY (CONT'D) Those faxes, the Have-You-Seen-Me's... How many of 'em is he actually responsible for? O'Ryan lays it right out: O'RYAN All of 'em. Mackelway nods, sobered. Cuffs O'Ryan to the steering wheel and approaches the house. 110. 189 EXT. RANCH HOUSE - WALKWAY -

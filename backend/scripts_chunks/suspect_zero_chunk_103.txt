102a Close on Mackelway as he returns to his Yukon satisfied. He is pleased with himself. Out of nowhere, a firm hand grasps his right shoulder stopping him. Mackelway turns abruptly, finding himself sandwiched between his Yukon and Charlton, who is now in his face. CHARLTON Listen to me Cowboy. You have any idea the kind of favors I had to pull with the Abilene cops to cover your ass?! MACKELWAY Sir... CHARLTON (not allowing him to talk) Breaking and ENTERING the Speck house without a shred of evidence and NO WARRANT?! MACKELWAY (not going down without a fight) The sample I took from Speck's bumper... It's crystallized sulfuric acid mixed with oil of Clove, the clove neutralizes the odor of the acid. Charlton shakes his head, he is not getting through. MACKELWAY (CONT'D) It was SPECK not his killer who was hiding something. CHARLTON Ever ask yourself why a big shot agent from Dallas gets sent down to the Wichita Falls Field Office? I'll give you TWO WORDS... Hell I'll even write it
